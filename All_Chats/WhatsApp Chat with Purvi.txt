4/11/24, 15:32 - HrishavSaha: I don't mean to be rude
4/11/24, 15:33 - HrishavSaha: Just... The topic at hand. I don't think I'm comfortable enough to talk about it over call
4/11/24, 15:33 - HrishavSaha: Is that fine?
4/11/24, 15:33 - Purvi: Hua kyaaa

4/11/24, 15:34 - Purvi: Noo
4/11/24, 15:34 - HrishavSaha: Then don't say "jaldi"
4/11/24, 15:34 - HrishavSaha: Okay
4/11/24, 15:34 - HrishavSaha: So
4/11/24, 15:34 - HrishavSaha: We're pretty close, I guess?
4/11/24, 15:34 - Purvi: Ha
4/11/24, 15:35 - HrishavSaha: I'd go as far to say that you're my best friend in the society
4/11/24, 15:35 - Purvi: Thanksss✨✨
4/11/24, 15:35 - Purvi: 😂😂
4/11/24, 15:35 - HrishavSaha: Please be serious for a while
4/11/24, 15:35 - Purvi: Okayyy
4/11/24, 15:36 - HrishavSaha: Now
4/11/24, 15:36 - HrishavSaha: I don't mind it when you joke about me
4/11/24, 15:36 - HrishavSaha: I laugh along too
4/11/24, 15:36 - HrishavSaha: But sometimes
4/11/24, 15:36 - HrishavSaha: The jokes get a bit excessive
4/11/24, 15:36 - Purvi: Oh
4/11/24, 15:37 - HrishavSaha: I didn't want to tell you about it
4/11/24, 15:37 - HrishavSaha: Because you'd probably feel bad
4/11/24, 15:37 - Purvi: I was definitely not expecting that
4/11/24, 15:37 - Purvi: Noo
4/11/24, 15:37 - Purvi: It's fine
4/11/24, 15:37 - HrishavSaha: I was trying to come to terms with it, convincing myself that it's your way of expressing care
4/11/24, 15:37 - HrishavSaha: Maybe it is
4/11/24, 15:38 - Purvi: I am actually reallyyyyy sorry
4/11/24, 15:38 - HrishavSaha: No, poorvi
4/11/24, 15:38 - Purvi: You are not the first person to sayy this
4/11/24, 15:38 - HrishavSaha: I'm not looking for an apology
4/11/24, 15:38 - Purvi: So
4/11/24, 15:39 - HrishavSaha: I don't think I've ever gotten attached to somebody, so fast, ever before
4/11/24, 15:39 - HrishavSaha: When we played, I wanted you on my team
4/11/24, 15:39 - HrishavSaha: If we were not on the same time, I targeted you as an opponent
4/11/24, 15:40 - HrishavSaha: I visit you almost everyday cuz I genuinely feel bad about your broken leg
4/11/24, 15:40 - HrishavSaha: Part of me wishes I was the one who got his leg broken instead of you
4/11/24, 15:40 - Purvi: 😶
4/11/24, 15:40 - HrishavSaha: My parents even thought that we were secretly dating or whatever
4/11/24, 15:41 - HrishavSaha: I cleared that topic though, no worries
4/11/24, 15:41 - Purvi: Realllyyy
4/11/24, 15:41 - Purvi: Thanks goddsss
4/11/24, 15:41 - HrishavSaha: Point is
4/11/24, 15:41 - HrishavSaha: I really like you
4/11/24, 15:41 - HrishavSaha: No
4/11/24, 15:41 - HrishavSaha: I love you
4/11/24, 15:41 - HrishavSaha: You're the sister I never had
4/11/24, 15:42 - HrishavSaha: Yeah, I sound cringe
4/11/24, 15:42 - Purvi: Awww✨✨
4/11/24, 15:42 - Purvi: No you don't
4/11/24, 15:42 - HrishavSaha: I don't mind if you joke about me
4/11/24, 15:42 - Purvi: You are also the brother I never had
4/11/24, 15:42 - HrishavSaha: Even if you do it excessively
4/11/24, 15:43 - HrishavSaha: But since you're the one I'm closest to, I also expect a large amount of validation from you
4/11/24, 15:43 - HrishavSaha: I wanted to avoid having this chat, cuz I'm gonna sound pathetic now
4/11/24, 15:43 - HrishavSaha: But I want to hear from you that I matter to you
4/11/24, 15:44 - Purvi: Oh myyy goddd
4/11/24, 15:44 - Purvi: You really doooo
4/11/24, 15:44 - Purvi: Don't sayy that
4/11/24, 15:44 - Purvi: Makes me feel guilty
4/11/24, 15:44 - HrishavSaha: And when I don't get that, that's what hurts. Not the jokes, or the Ramu Kaka stuff
4/11/24, 15:44 - HrishavSaha: Another reason why I didn't want to have this chat. I don't want to make you feel guilty, or on your guard around me
4/11/24, 15:45 - HrishavSaha: Last thing I want is to hurt you just cuz I'm hurt
4/11/24, 15:45 - Purvi: Im sorryyy
4/11/24, 15:45 - Purvi: Really I am
4/11/24, 15:45 - HrishavSaha: Pari and Mishthi already figured out that something is up with me
4/11/24, 15:45 - HrishavSaha: Please. Don't say that
4/11/24, 15:45 - HrishavSaha: And that it has something to do with you
4/11/24, 15:46 - HrishavSaha: They told me they'll speak to you about it
4/11/24, 15:46 - Purvi: Ki I joke
4/11/24, 15:47 - Purvi: About this??
4/11/24, 15:47 - HrishavSaha: They didn't. Cuz I didn't want them to. Last thing I want is for you to think I'm cringe, or pathetic, or that I'm overreacting
4/11/24, 15:47 - HrishavSaha: Yeah. That you joke more than necessary, and that you lack the ability of self realisation
4/11/24, 15:48 - HrishavSaha: Also, poorvi
4/11/24, 15:48 - Purvi: Is it really that bad
4/11/24, 15:48 - HrishavSaha: A bit. Yeah
4/11/24, 15:48 - HrishavSaha: I realised you can't take a hint
4/11/24, 15:48 - HrishavSaha: Know why?
4/11/24, 15:49 - HrishavSaha: All the times I mentioned watching a movie together
4/11/24, 15:49 - HrishavSaha: Did I ever say, "let's all watch a movie together"?
4/11/24, 15:49 - Purvi: No
4/11/24, 15:50 - HrishavSaha: I'm just gonna sound like a clingy and possessive boyfriend now maybe
4/11/24, 15:50 - HrishavSaha: But I really just wanted to spend some time with you, alone
4/11/24, 15:51 - HrishavSaha: Just didn't have the courage to voice my thoughts. Thought you might think that I'm being creepy, or that I have romantic feelings for you
4/11/24, 15:51 - Purvi: 😂😂
4/11/24, 15:51 - HrishavSaha: 😅
4/11/24, 15:51 - HrishavSaha: But it's true.
4/11/24, 15:52 - HrishavSaha: As it stands right now, among all the friends I have, you're the one who's closest to me
4/11/24, 15:52 - Purvi: Reallyyy
4/11/24, 15:52 - Purvi: That means sooo much
4/11/24, 15:52 - HrishavSaha: It's weird. I was laughing at myself last night
4/11/24, 15:52 - Purvi: Sameee
4/11/24, 15:52 - HrishavSaha: For getting so attached to someone, so soon
4/11/24, 15:53 - HrishavSaha: Maybe I've been denying myself this whole time, but the probable reason for the ice cream treat the other day was just so I could get you an ice cream
4/11/24, 15:54 - Purvi: I just want to get this clear thik ge
4/11/24, 15:54 - Purvi: I am sorry but is this a prank
4/11/24, 15:54 - HrishavSaha: No
4/11/24, 15:54 - Purvi: Sorryyyyyy
4/11/24, 15:54 - HrishavSaha: It's alright. It's understandable, why you'd think it's a prank
4/11/24, 15:54 - HrishavSaha: You were sus that it was a dare by Pari or mishthi, no?
4/11/24, 15:55 - Purvi: Yupp
4/11/24, 15:55 - HrishavSaha: Nah, it's not a prank
4/11/24, 15:55 - Purvi: Is it
4/11/24, 15:55 - HrishavSaha: Whatever I've said as of now
4/11/24, 15:55 - HrishavSaha: Every cringe and pathetic comment
4/11/24, 15:55 - HrishavSaha: I am serious and I 100% mean all of it
4/11/24, 15:56 - Purvi: I just want to hug youuu

4/11/24, 16:59 - HrishavSaha: I feel a lot lighter, AND a lot closer to you
4/11/24, 16:59 - HrishavSaha: Honestly, that hug you gave me? It's all I need

4/12/24, 14:53 - HrishavSaha: But you usually didn't stop at a proper time
4/12/24, 14:53 - Purvi: She said ki aap 3 4 din se dukhi the

4/12/24, 14:54 - HrishavSaha: I didn't exactly know how to talk to you about it...
4/12/24, 14:54 - HrishavSaha: Was partially hoping you'd realise something was wrong yourself
4/12/24, 14:54 - Purvi: Why were you stopping me when I was apologising
4/12/24, 14:55 - HrishavSaha: Cuz I don't want you to apologize

4/12/24, 14:55 - HrishavSaha: What I really needed was the hug
4/12/24, 14:55 - HrishavSaha: And the fact that you called me sweet
4/12/24, 14:56 - HrishavSaha: It really made me feel like my existence was important to you. That I matter

4/12/24, 22:26 - HrishavSaha: When I was with you till your parents arrived
4/12/24, 22:26 - HrishavSaha: I kinda got the vibe that your parents didn't really like me with you, alone in the house
4/12/24, 22:27 - HrishavSaha: I mean, I understand the reason why. But I just wanna confirm if they really were skeptical about me
4/12/24, 22:27 - Purvi: Noo
4/12/24, 22:27 - HrishavSaha: You sure?
4/12/24, 22:28 - Purvi: They are like this with almost every person
4/12/24, 22:28 - HrishavSaha: I don't mean to be rude, but it kinda seems like your dad forces a smile when I say something to him
4/12/24, 22:28 - Purvi: They don't make it obvious though
4/12/24, 22:28 - Purvi: Noo not at all
4/12/24, 22:28 - HrishavSaha: Then it's all good
4/12/24, 22:28 - Purvi: Ha nothing to worry about
4/12/24, 22:29 - HrishavSaha: Last thing I want is a "stay away from poorvi. Don't corrupt her." ultimatum
4/12/24, 22:29 - HrishavSaha: Great, then

4/17/24, 08:45 - HrishavSaha: So... What do you say? It's not like you'll have to jump a long way too
4/17/24, 08:46 - HrishavSaha: We've also got the sofa in front of the TV + tons of snacks

5/13/24, 21:14 - Purvi: I am not srry
5/13/24, 21:15 - Purvi: It was a joke
5/13/24, 21:15 - Purvi: Not that serious
5/13/24, 21:15 - Purvi: I can confirm or convince but I am not apologising
5/13/24, 21:16 - Purvi: And wth are you so mad aby
5/13/24, 21:16 - Purvi: *abt
5/13/24, 21:16 - HrishavSaha: Convincing is good enough
5/13/24, 21:16 - Purvi: ...
5/13/24, 21:16 - HrishavSaha: Poorvi, you won't get it
5/13/24, 21:17 - HrishavSaha: Finding it hard to believe the person you love the most
5/13/24, 21:17 - Purvi: Bruhh
5/13/24, 21:17 - HrishavSaha: Like I said, you won't get it
5/13/24, 21:17 - Purvi: You dont even know how much you hurt me
5/13/24, 21:17 - Purvi: I may not
5/13/24, 21:18 - Purvi: But saying you don't trust me
5/13/24, 21:18 - Purvi: Of all ppl
5/13/24, 21:18 - HrishavSaha: You think I want to?
5/13/24, 21:18 - HrishavSaha: Tanishka
5/13/24, 21:18 - Purvi: Don't call me that
5/13/24, 21:18 - HrishavSaha: I'll let you in on something
5/13/24, 21:18 - HrishavSaha: Fine
5/13/24, 21:18 - HrishavSaha: Poorvi
5/13/24, 21:18 - HrishavSaha: Here's something I never told anyone
5/13/24, 21:19 - HrishavSaha: Remember I always tell you, "if I ever had a girlfriend, I'd still love you the most"?
5/13/24, 21:19 - Purvi: Yupp
5/13/24, 21:19 - HrishavSaha: Well
5/13/24, 21:19 - HrishavSaha: I have a girlfriend
5/13/24, 21:19 - HrishavSaha: For two and a half months now
5/13/24, 21:19 - Purvi: Wtfffffdfdd
5/13/24, 21:19 - HrishavSaha: And I still love you the most
5/13/24, 21:19 - Purvi: Why didn't you tell meee
5/13/24, 21:20 - Purvi: Whoooooo
5/13/24, 21:20 - Purvi: Omgghh
5/13/24, 21:20 - HrishavSaha: I've been meaning to. Didn't get a good moment
5/13/24, 21:20 - HrishavSaha: The girl I was video calling
5/13/24, 21:20 - Purvi: Nooooo
5/13/24, 21:20 - HrishavSaha: Either way, we can talk about her later
5/13/24, 21:20 - HrishavSaha: Point is
5/13/24, 21:21 - HrishavSaha: Things aren't great between us since yesterday
5/13/24, 21:21 - HrishavSaha: And it's my fault too. I completely stopped texted or messaging anyone from yesterday <This message was edited>
5/13/24, 21:22 - HrishavSaha: We're practically on the verge of breaking up
5/13/24, 21:22 - HrishavSaha: And I realise I should be concerned about my relationship with her
5/13/24, 21:22 - HrishavSaha: But honestly? I couldn't care less
5/13/24, 21:23 - Purvi: Do you "like" her like her or timepass like her
5/13/24, 21:23 - HrishavSaha: Right now, all I can think about is when poorvi will come to home, tell my mom that she was just joking and that she'd go against anyone to protect my self respect if it came to that, and I can start hanging out with you again
5/13/24, 21:23 - Purvi: ??
5/13/24, 21:23 - Purvi: 🥹🥲
5/13/24, 21:24 - Purvi: I will
5/13/24, 21:24 - HrishavSaha: It's not time pass, that's for sure. As for love though, my sense of emotions is skewed. I don't even know what love is, beyond the fact that we care for someone we love
5/13/24, 21:24 - HrishavSaha: I'll wait
5/13/24, 21:24 - HrishavSaha: Also
5/13/24, 21:25 - HrishavSaha: I know it won't come to that. Hopefully
5/13/24, 21:25 - HrishavSaha: But
5/13/24, 21:25 - HrishavSaha: My trust in you is almost equivalent to blind trust <This message was edited>
5/13/24, 21:25 - Purvi: Srry srry
5/13/24, 21:25 - Purvi: I gotta go
5/13/24, 21:25 - Purvi: Ttyl
5/13/24, 21:25 - HrishavSaha: It's alright
5/13/24, 21:25 - Purvi: Pakka
5/13/24, 21:26 - HrishavSaha: Like I said. I'll wait
5/13/24, 21:55 - Purvi: heyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy
5/13/24, 21:55 - HrishavSaha: Heyy
5/13/24, 21:56 - HrishavSaha: Shouldn't you be asleep now?
5/13/24, 21:56 - Purvi: no
5/13/24, 21:56 - Purvi: kal meri chutti he
5/13/24, 21:56 - HrishavSaha: Due to the whole bomb stuff?
5/13/24, 21:57 - Purvi: mere summer vacations chal rhe he

5/13/24, 21:57 - HrishavSaha: Ah

5/13/24, 21:57 - HrishavSaha: Well
5/13/24, 21:57 - Purvi: yeah
5/13/24, 21:57 - HrishavSaha: Will you be free in the morning?
5/13/24, 21:57 - Purvi: kal aapki chutti he?
5/13/24, 21:57 - HrishavSaha: Nope
5/13/24, 21:57 - HrishavSaha: But I'll just take a leave
5/13/24, 21:58 - HrishavSaha: My mom won't resist much, considering the bomb threats and all
5/13/24, 21:58 - Purvi: aapke school mein bhi aaya
5/13/24, 21:58 - HrishavSaha: Not really
5/13/24, 21:58 - HrishavSaha: Only 4-5 schools got it
5/13/24, 21:58 - HrishavSaha: But every school is on alert right now
5/13/24, 21:58 - Purvi: diva ke school mein aaya
5/13/24, 21:59 - Purvi: did you know?\
5/13/24, 21:59 - HrishavSaha: Jatin's school too
5/13/24, 21:59 - Purvi: but voh aaj nhi gayi
5/13/24, 21:59 - HrishavSaha: Good for her
5/13/24, 21:59 - Purvi: kaunsa school
5/13/24, 21:59 - HrishavSaha: St. Xavier
5/13/24, 21:59 - Purvi: hmm
5/13/24, 21:59 - Purvi: I was about ask something
5/13/24, 21:59 - Purvi: wait
5/13/24, 21:59 - HrishavSaha: Sure
5/13/24, 22:00 - Purvi: matlab
5/13/24, 22:00 - HrishavSaha: Well, um
5/13/24, 22:00 - HrishavSaha: You see
5/13/24, 22:00 - HrishavSaha: There's stuff in this world
5/13/24, 22:00 - HrishavSaha: That have fixed and definitive meaning
5/13/24, 22:01 - HrishavSaha: And stuff that don't have a fixed meaning
5/13/24, 22:01 - HrishavSaha: I struggle to understand stuff that don't have a fixed definition
5/13/24, 22:01 - Purvi: stoppppppp
5/13/24, 22:01 - Purvi: fixed, stuff, meaning
5/13/24, 22:01 - Purvi: ???
5/13/24, 22:02 - HrishavSaha: Well, love is an emotion that's loosely defined
5/13/24, 22:02 - HrishavSaha: Idk what exactly it is
5/13/24, 22:02 - HrishavSaha: And so, I fail to understand the difference between simply caring for someone, and loving someone
5/13/24, 22:03 - HrishavSaha: I care for my girlfriend, but I don't know if I love her
5/13/24, 22:03 - HrishavSaha: I probably don't
5/13/24, 22:03 - HrishavSaha: As for you... I may not know the definition of love, but I'm sure I love you. Idk why or how I know it. (you're free to laugh at me)
5/13/24, 22:04 - Purvi: 😂😂
5/13/24, 22:04 - HrishavSaha: I've had some... Unspeakable trauma related to girls
5/13/24, 22:04 - HrishavSaha: So I have trouble around girls in general
5/13/24, 22:05 - HrishavSaha: Weirdly enough, I don't have any trouble with you. In fact, I forget about stuff that's happened with me
5/13/24, 22:05 - HrishavSaha: I'm pretty you've noticed that I get touchy Feely with you, but not a single other girl in the society, including diva, who's also a close friend
5/13/24, 22:06 - HrishavSaha: To test the theory, I once put a hand on her shoulder. It felt weird and scary, to say the least
5/13/24, 22:06 - HrishavSaha: But I have no problem with you
5/13/24, 22:06 - Purvi: on your gf right
5/13/24, 22:06 - HrishavSaha: I mean diva
5/13/24, 22:07 - Purvi: yeah b we have a diff relationship
5/13/24, 22:07 - Purvi: ohk
5/13/24, 22:07 - HrishavSaha: As for my girlfriend, well, idk. It felt weird hugging her
5/13/24, 22:07 - Purvi: really
5/13/24, 22:07 - HrishavSaha: I've hugged her a few times. Kissed a few times too
5/13/24, 22:08 - Purvi: grossss
5/13/24, 22:08 - HrishavSaha: But honestly, I didn't like them much
5/13/24, 22:08 - HrishavSaha: I did it all mostly to make her happy
5/13/24, 22:08 - Purvi: you should not if you are uncomfortable with it
5/13/24, 22:08 - HrishavSaha: You're also the one to know the most about... Well, my issue with girls
5/13/24, 22:09 - Purvi: i dont
5/13/24, 22:09 - HrishavSaha: Well, that's why we're on the verge of a breakup rn
5/13/24, 22:09 - Purvi: ohhh
5/13/24, 22:09 - HrishavSaha: I want to breakup. Been trying for a month now
5/13/24, 22:09 - HrishavSaha: But she practically gets suicidal every time
5/13/24, 22:09 - Purvi: tbh she does look kind of chomu for you
5/13/24, 22:10 - Purvi: realllyyyyyyyyy
5/13/24, 22:10 - HrishavSaha: And they're not empty threats. I've seen some marks. She's tried before, for her ex

5/13/24, 22:10 - Purvi: attention seekig
5/13/24, 22:10 - HrishavSaha: I ain't going for the looks, yaar. She's a really nice girl, she is. But I just don't... Love her, to be precise
5/13/24, 22:11 - HrishavSaha: Now if I tell that to her
5/13/24, 22:11 - HrishavSaha: She'll say, "I know. The fault is within me only"
5/13/24, 22:11 - Purvi: wait
5/13/24, 22:11 - HrishavSaha: Okay

5/15/24, 11:31 - Purvi: wait
5/15/24, 11:31 - HrishavSaha: 1. It should be scheduled for morning to evening, not night
2. If it's beyond 1 km, an adult must accompany us
5/15/24, 11:32 - HrishavSaha: Is this fine?
5/15/24, 11:38 - Purvi: hiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii

5/15/24, 11:40 - Purvi: wil your parents go?
5/15/24, 11:40 - HrishavSaha: But if we guys go out together, I'm the only adult in the group, and as such, I'll be the guardian of you guys, legally. And I don't think I wanna be responsible if something were to happen
5/15/24, 11:40 - HrishavSaha: My dad might. He could even drop us
5/15/24, 11:40 - Purvi: ok

5/17/24, 22:25 - Purvi: When my dada was sick
5/17/24, 22:25 - Purvi: He had caner
5/17/24, 22:25 - Purvi: He wanted to be around me
5/17/24, 22:26 - Purvi: And I would just sit in his room and read a novel
5/17/24, 22:26 - Purvi: Or watch phone
5/17/24, 22:26 - Purvi: Not talk to him
5/17/24, 22:26 - Purvi: I thought he didn't need that
5/17/24, 22:26 - Purvi: But when I had a fracture
5/17/24, 22:26 - Purvi: And I had to sit all day
5/17/24, 22:27 - Purvi: I was practically dead
5/17/24, 22:27 - Purvi: Bc I wanted ppl to be around me and talk to me
5/17/24, 22:27 - Purvi: Was this a weird time to tell this?
5/17/24, 22:27 - HrishavSaha: Nah
5/17/24, 22:27 - HrishavSaha: This feels like something you bottled up
5/17/24, 22:28 - HrishavSaha: And I'm more than happy to be your confidante
5/17/24, 22:28 - Purvi: It is
5/17/24, 22:28 - Purvi: Confidante?
5/17/24, 22:29 - HrishavSaha: Someone you can entrust your secrets to, share your inner emotions with
5/17/24, 22:29 - Purvi: Woah what are you google
5/17/24, 22:29 - Purvi: 😂😂
5/17/24, 22:29 - HrishavSaha: 😅
5/17/24, 22:29 - HrishavSaha: Anyway
5/17/24, 22:29 - HrishavSaha: I'll always be here for ya
5/17/24, 22:29 - Purvi: Ik
5/17/24, 22:30 - Purvi: Do you have any regrets
5/17/24, 22:30 - Purvi: Not chote ones
5/17/24, 22:30 - HrishavSaha: Well
5/17/24, 22:30 - HrishavSaha: There's one
5/17/24, 22:30 - HrishavSaha: So
5/17/24, 22:30 - HrishavSaha: Well, you see
5/17/24, 22:31 - HrishavSaha: I had a girlfriend
5/17/24, 22:31 - HrishavSaha: Back when I was in 9th
5/17/24, 22:31 - HrishavSaha: I remember that day vividly
5/17/24, 22:31 - HrishavSaha: It was 7:05am ish
5/17/24, 22:31 - HrishavSaha: She called me on WhatsApp call
5/17/24, 22:32 - HrishavSaha: Her parents are separated. She lives with her mother
5/17/24, 22:32 - HrishavSaha: She was walking to her dad's place
5/17/24, 22:33 - HrishavSaha: I told her to wait for her mom, and then go with her, cuz I didn't want her to cross the main road alone
5/17/24, 22:33 - HrishavSaha: Although she resisted initially, she finally agreed
5/17/24, 22:33 - HrishavSaha: Half an hour later, I called her again
5/17/24, 22:33 - HrishavSaha: She rejected the call
5/17/24, 22:34 - HrishavSaha: She texted me
5/17/24, 22:34 - HrishavSaha: "It's all over, Hri"
5/17/24, 22:34 - HrishavSaha: And when she finally picked up the phone, she was crying. Bad.
5/17/24, 22:35 - HrishavSaha: Her dad. He committed suicide
5/17/24, 22:35 - HrishavSaha: Apparently, he lost a lot of money on a chit fund that turned out to be a scam
5/17/24, 22:35 - HrishavSaha: And he was neck deep in debt
5/17/24, 22:36 - HrishavSaha: This was written in his note
5/17/24, 22:36 - HrishavSaha: And why were sneha and her mother on their way to his home that very morning? Cuz he wanted to see sneha the previous night, and sneha visited him in the morning, without informing him
5/17/24, 22:37 - Purvi: Fuckkkk
5/17/24, 22:37 - HrishavSaha: You know what's worse?
5/17/24, 22:37 - HrishavSaha: The police placed the time of death moments before sneha entered his dad's place
5/17/24, 22:38 - HrishavSaha: At around 7:20am
5/17/24, 22:38 - Purvi: How is this your regret
5/17/24, 22:38 - HrishavSaha: I wonder
5/17/24, 22:38 - HrishavSaha: If I didn't stop her
5/17/24, 22:39 - HrishavSaha: Maybe, JUST maybe, she'd have made it in time, and she'd still have her dad
5/17/24, 22:39 - Purvi: Well I don't think you should regret
5/17/24, 22:39 - HrishavSaha: Maybe you're right
5/17/24, 22:39 - Purvi: I mean what if she had an accident
5/17/24, 22:39 - HrishavSaha: Yeah
5/17/24, 22:40 - HrishavSaha: There's lots of variables
5/17/24, 22:40 - HrishavSaha: She mightve had an accident
5/17/24, 22:40 - HrishavSaha: He mightve died already
5/17/24, 22:40 - HrishavSaha: I didn't know her dad's condition
5/17/24, 22:40 - HrishavSaha: Still
5/17/24, 22:41 - HrishavSaha: Intentional or not
5/17/24, 22:41 - Purvi: That is just so sad
5/17/24, 22:41 - HrishavSaha: I'm partially responsible for her sadness
5/17/24, 22:41 - Purvi: No you are not
5/17/24, 22:42 - HrishavSaha: She also told me afterwards
5/17/24, 22:42 - HrishavSaha: That she kind of hated her dad
5/17/24, 22:42 - HrishavSaha: I knew that already
5/17/24, 22:42 - HrishavSaha: But she also wanted her dad to notice her
5/17/24, 22:43 - HrishavSaha: And right when her dad needed her the most... She postponed it... Like an outing
5/17/24, 22:43 - HrishavSaha: Those were her words
5/17/24, 22:44 - Purvi: 💀
5/17/24, 22:44 - Purvi: That must be so hard on her
5/17/24, 22:44 - Purvi: *for
5/17/24, 22:44 - HrishavSaha: It was
5/17/24, 22:45 - Purvi: Let's not talk about regrets
5/17/24, 22:45 - HrishavSaha: It broke me to see her like that
5/17/24, 22:45 - HrishavSaha: Alright
5/17/24, 22:45 - HrishavSaha: Sorry. That was too much of a downer, wasn't it? 😅
5/17/24, 22:46 - Purvi: it's fine
5/17/24, 22:46 - HrishavSaha: Well
5/17/24, 22:46 - HrishavSaha: She's going strong now
5/17/24, 22:46 - HrishavSaha: Spoke to her just yesterday
5/17/24, 22:46 - Purvi: Oh
5/17/24, 22:47 - Purvi: Good good
5/17/24, 22:47 - HrishavSaha: Yep
5/17/24, 22:47 - HrishavSaha: It was nice to tell this to someone
5/17/24, 22:47 - Purvi: My friend also lost her dad when she was like 10
5/17/24, 22:47 - HrishavSaha: Without being judged hard
5/17/24, 22:47 - Purvi: 💖💖
5/17/24, 22:48 - HrishavSaha: Thanks, cutie
5/17/24, 22:48 - Purvi: Why would anyone judge you for this
5/17/24, 22:48 - Purvi: And I know sounds unreal
5/17/24, 22:48 - Purvi: But
5/17/24, 22:48 - Purvi: He used to come in her dreams
5/17/24, 22:48 - HrishavSaha: Haha, well, you're the second person I told this to. The first person just said... "don't be sad. He was supposed to die that day"
5/17/24, 22:49 - Purvi: That is so insensitive
5/17/24, 22:49 - Purvi: I can't believe I am saying that
5/17/24, 22:49 - Purvi: Who though
5/17/24, 22:49 - HrishavSaha: This is just... Sad
5/17/24, 22:49 - HrishavSaha: 😂
5/17/24, 22:49 - Purvi: Not his spirit
5/17/24, 22:50 - Purvi: Maybe it was her subconscious mind
5/17/24, 22:50 - HrishavSaha: A classmate here in jaipur
5/17/24, 22:50 - HrishavSaha: Maybe. It's still a nice thing
5/17/24, 22:50 - HrishavSaha: Knowing he's still there, even if he's gone
5/17/24, 22:50 - Purvi: They were not exactly comforting
5/17/24, 22:51 - Purvi: His dad would say that now you have succed in life
5/17/24, 22:51 - Purvi: Not let him down
5/17/24, 22:52 - Purvi: Stuff like that
5/17/24, 22:52 - Purvi: Motivation I guess
5/17/24, 22:52 - HrishavSaha: How's she now?
5/17/24, 22:52 - Purvi: A lot better
5/17/24, 22:52 - HrishavSaha: That's good
5/17/24, 22:53 - Purvi: She is my bestfriend
5/17/24, 22:53 - HrishavSaha: Oh
5/17/24, 22:53 - Purvi: Like we are a trio
5/17/24, 22:53 - HrishavSaha: Mmhmm
5/17/24, 22:53 - HrishavSaha: What's her name?
5/17/24, 22:53 - Purvi: Ishita
5/17/24, 22:54 - HrishavSaha: That's a beautiful name
5/17/24, 22:54 - HrishavSaha: Unlike Tanishka
5/17/24, 22:54 - Purvi: Plss
5/17/24, 22:54 - HrishavSaha: 😂

5/17/24, 22:58 - Purvi: I think your narcissistic self should know that
5/17/24, 22:58 - HrishavSaha: Maybe
5/17/24, 22:59 - Purvi: I will tell you
5/17/24, 22:59 - Purvi: Your most likable and unlikabe trait
5/17/24, 22:59 - Purvi: Alright

5/17/24, 23:02 - HrishavSaha: Before that
5/17/24, 23:02 - HrishavSaha: I wanna throw a bit of a disclaimer
5/17/24, 23:02 - Purvi: Kya
5/17/24, 23:03 - HrishavSaha: I'm sorry if I sometimes seem that I'm getting overly friendly with you
5/17/24, 23:03 - HrishavSaha: You're someone VERY close to me
5/17/24, 23:03 - HrishavSaha: And I'm actually a lot more touchy than I let on😂
5/17/24, 23:03 - Purvi: You really don't have to be srry for that
5/17/24, 23:04 - HrishavSaha: But I try my best to keep it in check cuz, well, I don't want rumours like "hrishav and Poorvi are definitely dating"
5/17/24, 23:04 - Purvi: Yeahh
5/17/24, 23:05 - Purvi: And same
5/17/24, 23:05 - Purvi: I have never been this close to a person so fast
5/17/24, 23:06 - HrishavSaha: Haha, same

5/17/24, 23:06 - HrishavSaha: Ah, well
5/17/24, 23:06 - Purvi: Anywaysss
5/17/24, 23:07 - HrishavSaha: You're giving a serious declaration of your emotions
5/17/24, 23:07 - HrishavSaha: That's rare
5/17/24, 23:07 - Purvi: You don't want me to
5/17/24, 23:07 - HrishavSaha: I do want you to
5/17/24, 23:08 - HrishavSaha: It's just that you're a little too unserious most of the time
5/17/24, 23:08 - HrishavSaha: 😂
5/17/24, 23:08 - HrishavSaha: Nevertheless, you're mine
5/17/24, 23:08 - HrishavSaha: ♥️
5/17/24, 23:08 - Purvi: 💖💖
5/17/24, 23:09 - Purvi: And you are mine

5/17/24, 23:09 - Purvi: ...
5/17/24, 23:09 - HrishavSaha: Yep
5/17/24, 23:09 - HrishavSaha: One unlikeable trait, coming right up
5/17/24, 23:10 - HrishavSaha: You have a malfunctioning "read the mood" module in your brain
5/17/24, 23:11 - HrishavSaha: You tend to make jokes or dismiss stuff as unimportant, in situations that demand seriousness
5/17/24, 23:11 - HrishavSaha: 😂
5/17/24, 23:11 - HrishavSaha: You hate my seriousness, I hate your unseriousness
5/17/24, 23:11 - HrishavSaha: Either way
5/17/24, 23:11 - HrishavSaha: Something I like about you
5/17/24, 23:12 - HrishavSaha: Well
5/17/24, 23:12 - HrishavSaha: Your hug
5/17/24, 23:12 - Purvi: Noo
5/17/24, 23:12 - HrishavSaha: It makes me feel at ease
5/17/24, 23:12 - HrishavSaha: I mean it
5/17/24, 23:12 - Purvi: Personality trait
5/17/24, 23:12 - HrishavSaha: Oh
5/17/24, 23:12 - HrishavSaha: Okay, um
5/17/24, 23:13 - HrishavSaha: Yep, it's difficult
5/17/24, 23:13 - HrishavSaha: 😂😂
5/17/24, 23:13 - Purvi: Why is it taking you so much timee
5/17/24, 23:13 - Purvi: Am I not likable or smth
5/17/24, 23:13 - Purvi: 😂😂
5/17/24, 23:13 - HrishavSaha: No, it's not that😂
5/17/24, 23:13 - HrishavSaha: You know I like you
5/17/24, 23:13 - HrishavSaha: A lot
5/17/24, 23:13 - HrishavSaha: But why? That's a mystery, even to me
5/17/24, 23:14 - Purvi: Not even a single thing
5/17/24, 23:14 - HrishavSaha: Maybe I like your carefree nature
5/17/24, 23:14 - HrishavSaha: I kinda wish sometimes that I could be as carefree as you are
5/17/24, 23:14 - HrishavSaha: Ofcourse, you have your fair share of worries
5/17/24, 23:15 - HrishavSaha: But honestly, I hate the depression that eats away at me each night
5/17/24, 23:15 - HrishavSaha: That's the reason I'm glued to my screen at home. Trying to divert my mind from negative thoughts
5/17/24, 23:15 - HrishavSaha: And then you came along and dashed right through all of it
5/17/24, 23:16 - Purvi: 😂😂
5/17/24, 23:16 - HrishavSaha: You're healing me, if that makes sense
5/17/24, 23:16 - HrishavSaha: I would normally never admit that to you, cuz you'd just laugh it off
5/17/24, 23:16 - HrishavSaha: But I think I timed the mood right?
5/17/24, 23:17 - Purvi: I sooo wanted to send laughing emojis
5/17/24, 23:17 - Purvi: But yes
5/17/24, 23:17 - HrishavSaha: See, I knew
5/17/24, 23:17 - Purvi: Washroom break
5/17/24, 23:17 - HrishavSaha: Go on
5/17/24, 23:17 - Purvi: Brb
5/17/24, 23:21 - Purvi: Heyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy

5/17/24, 23:23 - Purvi: It's not that hard
5/17/24, 23:24 - Purvi: And this is just default
5/17/24, 23:24 - HrishavSaha: Guess so
5/17/24, 23:24 - Purvi: And maybee
5/17/24, 23:24 - Purvi: I do read the mood
5/17/24, 23:25 - HrishavSaha: Occasionally
5/17/24, 23:25 - Purvi: But just don't want to stay it that wayyy
5/17/24, 23:25 - Purvi: And my jokes sometimes work
5/17/24, 23:25 - HrishavSaha: You have a point
5/17/24, 23:26 - HrishavSaha: You knoa
5/17/24, 23:26 - HrishavSaha: Know
5/17/24, 23:26 - HrishavSaha: Um
5/17/24, 23:26 - HrishavSaha: I wanted to ask something
5/17/24, 23:26 - HrishavSaha: Not sure if I should though
5/17/24, 23:26 - Purvi: Askkkj
5/17/24, 23:26 - HrishavSaha: Before I do ask
5/17/24, 23:26 - Purvi: Just askk
5/17/24, 23:27 - HrishavSaha: Please don't be offended by the question
5/17/24, 23:27 - HrishavSaha: But, err
5/17/24, 23:27 - HrishavSaha: Do you like me?
5/17/24, 23:27 - Purvi: Have fucking lost your mind
5/17/24, 23:27 - HrishavSaha: I told you, don't be offended
5/17/24, 23:27 - HrishavSaha: I'm sorry
5/17/24, 23:28 - Purvi: You should be
5/17/24, 23:28 - HrishavSaha: I thought so too
5/17/24, 23:28 - HrishavSaha: That you don't
5/17/24, 23:28 - HrishavSaha: So that's good
5/17/24, 23:28 - Purvi: What made you think that
5/17/24, 23:28 - HrishavSaha: Someone told me, that's all
5/17/24, 23:28 - Purvi: Whoooo
5/17/24, 23:29 - HrishavSaha: You know who it could be
5/17/24, 23:29 - Purvi: I have 2 options
5/17/24, 23:29 - Purvi: But in no mood to guess
5/17/24, 23:29 - HrishavSaha: Either way
5/17/24, 23:29 - HrishavSaha: Forget about that
5/17/24, 23:30 - HrishavSaha: Sorry
5/17/24, 23:30 - Purvi: Noo
5/17/24, 23:30 - Purvi: I want to know

5/17/24, 23:31 - HrishavSaha: Why would any of them think that way?
5/17/24, 23:31 - Purvi: They are mutuals
5/17/24, 23:31 - Purvi: Who else could say that

5/17/24, 23:38 - Purvi: Why would I do that
5/17/24, 23:39 - HrishavSaha: Well, why would you be conscious of your breathing?
5/17/24, 23:39 - Purvi: I donno
5/17/24, 23:39 - Purvi: And then I start yawning a lot

5/23/24, 11:40 - HrishavSaha: But the more and more I followed up with the prank to try and get you to believe it
5/23/24, 11:40 - HrishavSaha: I sorta realised that I do like ya that way

5/29/24, 12:07 - HrishavSaha: I can just go
5/29/24, 12:08 - HrishavSaha: I have the mental resolve to know that my personal self esteem is more important than money
5/29/24, 12:08 - Purvi: I am not joking
5/29/24, 12:08 - Purvi: Thik he

5/29/24, 12:12 - HrishavSaha: Well, I also feel that I'm being disrespected
5/29/24, 12:12 - HrishavSaha: Or is that my illusion?
5/29/24, 12:16 - Purvi: It's your illusion
5/29/24, 12:16 - HrishavSaha: Fine
5/29/24, 12:16 - HrishavSaha: The classes are an illusion too
5/29/24, 12:16 - HrishavSaha: They're useless
5/29/24, 13:30 - Purvi: You know what
5/29/24, 13:30 - Purvi: If you wanna believe your classes are useless than do so
5/29/24, 13:30 - Purvi: Get more reasons to rant about
5/29/24, 13:31 - Purvi: You just can't move on from the ladai
5/29/24, 13:31 - HrishavSaha: This is not a "ladai"
5/29/24, 13:31 - Purvi: Misunderstanding
5/29/24, 13:32 - Purvi: On you part
5/29/24, 13:32 - HrishavSaha: Nope
5/29/24, 13:32 - HrishavSaha: Imagine teaching a bunch of students who are all busy wondering when they'll finally get to go home
5/29/24, 13:32 - HrishavSaha: Maybe you'll get it
5/29/24, 13:33 - HrishavSaha: The humiliation is real
5/29/24, 13:33 - Purvi: Again we are not fucking humiliating you
5/29/24, 13:33 - HrishavSaha: Not intentionally, ofcourse
5/29/24, 13:33 - HrishavSaha: But it's happening
5/29/24, 13:34 - HrishavSaha: I'm not negotiating with you
5/29/24, 13:34 - Purvi: Whatever
5/29/24, 13:34 - HrishavSaha: Either you accept and listen to whatever I tell you as a teacher, or get a new one
5/29/24, 13:34 - HrishavSaha: I can't get any clearer
5/29/24, 13:35 - Purvi: You were clear
5/29/24, 13:35 - Purvi: And I accepted it
5/29/24, 13:35 - Purvi: And then ranted again
5/29/24, 13:35 - Purvi: So now
5/29/24, 13:35 - Purvi: Are we good?
5/29/24, 13:35 - HrishavSaha: For now
5/29/24, 13:35 - HrishavSaha: But the next time would be the last time, poorvi
5/29/24, 13:36 - HrishavSaha: No more "I accept your terms"
5/29/24, 13:36 - Purvi: Wtfff
5/29/24, 13:36 - Purvi: Whatever
5/29/24, 13:36 - HrishavSaha: You don't understand what "for now" means, does it?
5/29/24, 13:37 - Purvi: You make being difficult look so easy
5/29/24, 13:37 - Purvi: 😂😂💀
5/29/24, 13:37 - HrishavSaha: It's "yeah, until it happens again"
5/29/24, 13:37 - Purvi: I did
5/29/24, 13:37 - HrishavSaha: Cuz I HAVE to go through difficulties
5/29/24, 13:37 - Purvi: You didn't get it
5/29/24, 13:38 - HrishavSaha: You don't know the way I live my life
5/29/24, 13:38 - HrishavSaha: Even if you do, you probably won't get the agenda
5/29/24, 13:38 - Purvi: Then tell me
5/29/24, 13:39 - Purvi: I will get it

5/29/24, 13:39 - HrishavSaha: Doesn't just mean "okay, sir"
5/29/24, 13:39 - HrishavSaha: What happened to your "I will get it"?
5/29/24, 13:39 - Purvi: Kk
5/29/24, 13:39 - Purvi: I get it
5/29/24, 13:40 - HrishavSaha: If you believe what I'm saying is funny, don't talk to me
5/29/24, 13:40 - Purvi: Can you just fucking stop
5/29/24, 13:40 - HrishavSaha: With pleasure
5/29/24, 13:40 - Purvi: The topic is overrrrrrr
5/29/24, 13:40 - Purvi: Good
5/29/24, 13:41 - HrishavSaha: I could never be as carefree as you are
5/29/24, 13:41 - Purvi: Good for you
5/29/24, 13:57 - HrishavSaha: I have something to ask
5/29/24, 13:57 - HrishavSaha: Yesterday, when we were coming back from the club
5/29/24, 13:57 - HrishavSaha: Why'd you ask me that question?
5/29/24, 13:58 - Purvi: Bc you said you were pranking me
5/29/24, 13:58 - Purvi: And then you realised
5/29/24, 13:58 - Purvi: And then when you came back
5/29/24, 13:59 - Purvi: Everything was so normal
5/29/24, 13:59 - HrishavSaha: Was?
5/29/24, 13:59 - Purvi: I thought you were just confused that time

5/29/24, 14:07 - Purvi: Yup
5/29/24, 14:08 - HrishavSaha: Okay, cool
5/29/24, 14:08 - HrishavSaha: Did you get the answer you expected?
5/29/24, 14:09 - Purvi: Yup
5/29/24, 14:10 - HrishavSaha: You were... Expecting me to say that I still love you?
5/29/24, 14:10 - Purvi: I donno
5/29/24, 14:10 - Purvi: I didn't expect anything
5/29/24, 14:10 - HrishavSaha: Alright

5/29/24, 14:12 - HrishavSaha: Idk. Just said
5/29/24, 14:13 - HrishavSaha: It's not very Poorvi-like to question a leave
5/29/24, 14:13 - Purvi: No just why
5/29/24, 14:13 - Purvi: And mamma wouldn't allow it
5/29/24, 14:13 - HrishavSaha: Fine then

5/29/24, 20:22 - HrishavSaha: You asked me my problem
5/29/24, 20:23 - HrishavSaha: It's the fact that I have conflicting feelings
5/29/24, 20:25 - HrishavSaha: Sorry
5/29/24, 21:22 - Purvi: It's not ok
5/29/24, 21:23 - HrishavSaha: What is not OK?

5/29/24, 21:24 - Purvi: Vaise what did you say srry for
5/29/24, 21:24 - HrishavSaha: .
5/29/24, 21:25 - HrishavSaha: I was fine and sorta forgot about me having shit for you
5/29/24, 21:25 - HrishavSaha: But you asked that question yesterday. And that made me overthink that maybe you were considering the proposal
5/29/24, 21:26 - HrishavSaha: And then there were today's bullshit. All of it sorta made me go haywire
5/29/24, 21:26 - HrishavSaha: I love you and partially hate you at the same time
5/29/24, 21:28 - Purvi: Today's bullshit was all bc of you
5/29/24, 21:28 - Purvi: And you hate me??
5/29/24, 21:29 - HrishavSaha: I really don't wanna argue again. Can we not, please?
5/29/24, 21:29 - Purvi: ...
5/29/24, 21:29 - HrishavSaha: For what happened today
5/29/24, 21:29 - Purvi: Ohhhh
5/29/24, 21:29 - Purvi: Waitttt
5/29/24, 21:29 - HrishavSaha: It's a fact that you have been rude to me
5/29/24, 21:30 - Purvi: So that was bc of me
5/29/24, 21:30 - HrishavSaha: Is this a moment of realisation or a "so you're accusing me now?"
5/29/24, 21:34 - Purvi: What do you think
5/29/24, 21:34 - Purvi: Nhi what do you rhink
5/29/24, 21:35 - HrishavSaha: I'm hoping it's a moment of realisation
5/29/24, 21:35 - Purvi: 💀
5/29/24, 21:35 - Purvi: It was your fault
5/29/24, 21:35 - HrishavSaha: I don't wanna argue rn

5/29/24, 21:36 - Purvi: It's my pleasure
5/29/24, 21:36 - HrishavSaha: I'm a teacher and a friend
5/29/24, 21:36 - HrishavSaha: Let's just keep it at that
5/29/24, 21:37 - HrishavSaha: It's pretty evident that our thought processes and mentalities don't match
5/29/24, 21:37 - Purvi: So what
5/29/24, 21:38 - HrishavSaha: So it's best if we don't do shit that makes us look like we're the best of friends
5/29/24, 21:38 - HrishavSaha: Cuz we'll fight constantly then
5/29/24, 21:39 - Purvi: Ok
5/29/24, 21:39 - Purvi: Fine
5/29/24, 21:39 - Purvi: Ttyl
5/29/24, 21:39 - HrishavSaha: Yep
5/29/24, 21:40 - HrishavSaha: I hate this as much as you do, but we just don't fit together well enough to properly understand each other
5/29/24, 21:41 - HrishavSaha: And let's just forget I ever proposed to you. We were halfway on the way to forgetting anyway, but whatever
5/29/24, 21:42 - Purvi: What do you want me to say

6/6/24, 22:59 - Purvi: Ask awayyy
6/6/24, 23:00 - HrishavSaha: You realise that I want you to be more tolerant, polite and understanding and mature, right?

6/6/24, 23:01 - HrishavSaha: Well
6/6/24, 23:01 - HrishavSaha: My question is
6/6/24, 23:01 - HrishavSaha: Why do you think I'm putting in the effort?

6/6/24, 23:03 - HrishavSaha: Cmon, that's not good enough of a reason
6/6/24, 23:03 - HrishavSaha: I mean, I do love you. And I want you to be better. But that's not it
6/6/24, 23:03 - Purvi: Sooo what is itt
6/6/24, 23:03 - Purvi: Brain not braining
6/6/24, 23:04 - HrishavSaha: Well, Tanishka
6/6/24, 23:05 - HrishavSaha: It's because I, on the rare occasion, imagine you by my side
6/6/24, 23:05 - Purvi: Huh?
6/6/24, 23:06 - HrishavSaha: You didn't understand, did you?
6/6/24, 23:07 - Purvi: You think?
6/6/24, 23:07 - HrishavSaha: Well
6/6/24, 23:07 - HrishavSaha: I want us to connect better
6/6/24, 23:07 - Purvi: Samee
6/6/24, 23:08 - HrishavSaha: And I want to feel that investing my energy in this relationship is worth it
6/6/24, 23:09 - HrishavSaha: Cuz let's be honest, the way things are rn, if you weren't studying under me, chances are that after that stfu situation, we'd have completely stopped talking
6/6/24, 23:09 - HrishavSaha: And that might happen in the future too
6/6/24, 23:09 - HrishavSaha: What matters is whether we, as a unit, want that to happen, or not
6/6/24, 23:10 - Purvi: Of course nott
6/6/24, 23:10 - Purvi: Idk
6/6/24, 23:10 - Purvi: Gotta go ttyl

6/7/24, 14:13 - Purvi: Ohk
6/7/24, 14:13 - HrishavSaha: Chatting is a waste of time
6/7/24, 14:14 - HrishavSaha: I barely text any of my friends except for specific reasons
6/7/24, 14:14 - HrishavSaha: And since you want me to admit stuff
6/7/24, 14:14 - HrishavSaha: I'll admit that... I'm willing to waste some of my time on you
6/7/24, 14:14 - HrishavSaha: (that's a compliment)

6/7/24, 14:14 - Purvi: But you text all the time

6/7/24, 14:16 - HrishavSaha: So that adds up
6/7/24, 14:16 - Purvi: Ohkk
6/7/24, 14:16 - HrishavSaha: My idle time on WhatsApp is probably about 70%. The remaining 30% is when I'm actually texting

6/7/24, 22:14 - HrishavSaha: One class for ritika from 6:30 - 7:30
6/7/24, 22:14 - Purvi: I miss swimming

6/7/24, 22:15 - Purvi: Acha I ll ask some timepass Q's
6/7/24, 22:15 - HrishavSaha: Ask away
6/7/24, 22:16 - Purvi: What do you think is a mistake I ll definitely do
6/7/24, 22:16 - Purvi: Future mein
6/7/24, 22:16 - HrishavSaha: Accidentally saying curse words in front of seniors
6/7/24, 22:17 - Purvi: Was it that bad
6/7/24, 22:17 - Purvi: Like does aunty hate me now
6/7/24, 22:17 - HrishavSaha: How do I answer that...
6/7/24, 22:17 - HrishavSaha: Well
6/7/24, 22:17 - HrishavSaha: She doesn't hate you
6/7/24, 22:17 - HrishavSaha: But I have a relatively strict order to maintain a bit of a distance from you
6/7/24, 22:18 - Purvi: Literally same
6/7/24, 22:18 - Purvi: But aapne toh kuch Kiya bhi nhi
6/7/24, 22:18 - HrishavSaha: Why you, though?
6/7/24, 22:18 - Purvi: So idk why
6/7/24, 22:18 - HrishavSaha: Yeah
6/7/24, 22:19 - HrishavSaha: Maybe it's just regular old "a boy and a girl can't be simple friends" logic?
6/7/24, 22:19 - Purvi: Probably
6/7/24, 22:19 - Purvi: But I did have many guy friends pehle
6/7/24, 22:19 - Purvi: Mamma was never strict like that
6/7/24, 22:20 - HrishavSaha: Maybe it is the whole stfu fiasco
6/7/24, 22:20 - HrishavSaha: You said stuff
6/7/24, 22:20 - HrishavSaha: My mom told me to maintain distance cuz you're bad influence and can potentially get me in trouble
6/7/24, 22:21 - HrishavSaha: Your mom told you to maintain distance cuz another accident like this might permanently turn things sour
6/7/24, 22:21 - Purvi: I am not actually bi
6/7/24, 22:21 - Purvi: Am i
6/7/24, 22:21 - HrishavSaha: Tbh, to a certain extent, yes
6/7/24, 22:21 - Purvi: Why
6/7/24, 22:21 - HrishavSaha: I ignore your red flags. That's a different matter
6/7/24, 22:21 - Purvi: Cause I say cuss words
6/7/24, 22:21 - HrishavSaha: That's... Not it
6/7/24, 22:22 - Purvi: Then what
6/7/24, 22:22 - HrishavSaha: Well, before I answer that, disclaimer, you can't get upset over what I say
6/7/24, 22:22 - Purvi: Say
6/7/24, 22:23 - HrishavSaha: You've got bit of an issue differentiating jokes and seriousness
6/7/24, 22:23 - HrishavSaha: A tad immature
6/7/24, 22:23 - Purvi: Thats not bad influence
6/7/24, 22:23 - HrishavSaha: Lack of ability to read the room, and poor timing
6/7/24, 22:24 - Purvi: And I am not that immature
6/7/24, 22:24 - HrishavSaha: I said "tad"
6/7/24, 22:24 - HrishavSaha: Either way
6/7/24, 22:24 - HrishavSaha: Whatever I'm saying need not be perfectly correct
6/7/24, 22:25 - HrishavSaha: You know your flaws best, I know mine. And it's always best to work on it yourself without external input
6/7/24, 22:25 - Purvi: Ohkk
6/7/24, 22:25 - Purvi: Whatever
6/7/24, 22:26 - HrishavSaha: Yeah
6/7/24, 22:26 - HrishavSaha: Just know that whatever you do
6/7/24, 22:26 - HrishavSaha: I'll be here for you
6/7/24, 22:26 - HrishavSaha: Not to cover up for you
6/7/24, 22:26 - HrishavSaha: But as someone you can lean on
6/7/24, 22:26 - Purvi: Ikik
6/7/24, 22:27 - Purvi: What if I become like viral on insta in one night
6/7/24, 22:27 - Purvi: What would I be doing
6/7/24, 22:27 - HrishavSaha: Doing some weird ass shit like drinking coke and mentos together
6/7/24, 22:27 - Purvi: 😂😂💀
6/7/24, 22:27 - Purvi: Probably
6/7/24, 22:28 - HrishavSaha: Only for your nose to become an organic coke dispenser
6/7/24, 22:28 - Purvi: Everyone else I asked this was like
6/7/24, 22:28 - Purvi: I would be roasting someone
6/7/24, 22:29 - HrishavSaha: 😂Nah, you're not THAT good at it to become viral
6/7/24, 22:29 - Purvi: Ik right

6/7/24, 22:30 - HrishavSaha: No need to apologize
6/7/24, 22:30 - HrishavSaha: Just fix it
6/7/24, 22:31 - HrishavSaha: Anyway, what happened
6/7/24, 22:31 - Purvi: How do I fix it now
6/7/24, 22:31 - HrishavSaha: Say the sentence again with a proper word
6/7/24, 22:31 - Purvi: I have never roasted roasted them
6/7/24, 22:31 - HrishavSaha: Well, have you roasted someone else in their presence?

6/7/24, 22:34 - Purvi: Wait
6/7/24, 22:34 - HrishavSaha: I die everyday due to your cringe anyway 😂
6/7/24, 22:34 - HrishavSaha: And your smile resurrects me right after
6/7/24, 22:37 - Purvi: Resurrects?
6/7/24, 22:38 - HrishavSaha: Rebirth. Resurrection

6/7/24, 22:42 - Purvi: You are more cringe
6/7/24, 22:43 - HrishavSaha: The main reason I'm enforcing this rule while we're talking is cuz I don't want you accidentally cursing in front of my parents again and making it so that we can't meet at all
6/7/24, 22:43 - HrishavSaha: Thank you. I know😂. And I'm proud of it

6/7/24, 22:45 - HrishavSaha: Exactly
6/7/24, 22:46 - HrishavSaha: If I don't maintain what little cringe stuff I do with you, I'd be a dead serious person. I don't think you'd like that
6/7/24, 22:46 - Purvi: Mhmm

6/8/24, 14:25 - HrishavSaha: Betrayal
6/8/24, 14:25 - Purvi: It's smth long and pitiful
6/8/24, 14:25 - Purvi: Do you really wanna hear it
6/8/24, 14:26 - HrishavSaha: Yeah
6/8/24, 14:26 - HrishavSaha: I just wanna know you better
6/8/24, 14:26 - HrishavSaha: Make you feel close to me, I guess
6/8/24, 14:26 - Purvi: Ok
6/8/24, 14:26 - Purvi: It's funny I can still rant abt it
6/8/24, 14:27 - Purvi: So in like 8th grade
6/8/24, 14:27 - Purvi: I had a friend who was extremely attention seeking
6/8/24, 14:27 - Purvi: And always faked being suicidal
6/8/24, 14:28 - HrishavSaha: That's messed up
6/8/24, 14:28 - Purvi: So it was a group of 5
6/8/24, 14:28 - Purvi: I was in a trio still am
6/8/24, 14:28 - Purvi: So she used to switch friends every month like
6/8/24, 14:28 - Purvi: Like she used to pick one from to specific ppl
6/8/24, 14:29 - Purvi: And then one month she would be close to one
6/8/24, 14:29 - Purvi: And next month another
6/8/24, 14:29 - Purvi: And idk she knew some black magic or smth
6/8/24, 14:29 - Purvi: This continued for like a year
6/8/24, 14:30 - Purvi: Until I finally confronted her
6/8/24, 14:30 - Purvi: Was supposed to do it with a the duo mein other bachi
6/8/24, 14:31 - Purvi: And last min she flipped
6/8/24, 14:31 - Purvi: And then I was against those two
6/8/24, 14:31 - Purvi: With mere 2 frnds not present their
6/8/24, 14:31 - Purvi: And that girl is still stuck with
6/8/24, 14:31 - Purvi: The attention seeking frnd
6/8/24, 14:32 - Purvi: So yeahh😎😎
6/8/24, 14:32 - HrishavSaha: Lmao
6/8/24, 14:32 - HrishavSaha: That was a twist
6/8/24, 14:32 - Purvi: But I had to become the voice box
6/8/24, 14:32 - HrishavSaha: I thought it was the attention seeking girl who betrayed you somehow
6/8/24, 14:32 - Purvi: And things did not go so well
6/8/24, 14:32 - Purvi: Nope
6/8/24, 14:32 - HrishavSaha: Understandable
6/8/24, 14:33 - HrishavSaha: It's always the speaker who suffers
6/8/24, 14:33 - Purvi: I knew she was attention seeking start se
6/8/24, 14:33 - Purvi: But no one listened
6/8/24, 14:33 - Purvi: So yeah
6/8/24, 14:33 - Purvi: True
6/8/24, 14:33 - HrishavSaha: That's more of a sad memory than that of betrayal
6/8/24, 14:34 - HrishavSaha: Having your friend flip at the last moment
6/8/24, 14:34 - Purvi: I actually felt betrayed
6/8/24, 14:34 - Purvi: The person who flipped was a really good friend of mine
6/8/24, 14:34 - HrishavSaha: Thankfully, I've never experienced something like this
6/8/24, 14:35 - Purvi: Good
6/8/24, 14:35 - HrishavSaha: Mmhmm
6/8/24, 14:35 - Purvi: So no betrayals at all

6/8/24, 14:40 - HrishavSaha: Who are younger than me
6/8/24, 14:40 - Purvi: Oh
6/8/24, 14:40 - HrishavSaha: Yeah
6/8/24, 14:40 - HrishavSaha: There's this aunt in mumbai
6/8/24, 14:40 - HrishavSaha: Sinjini
6/8/24, 14:41 - HrishavSaha: She almost strangled me when I called her aunt
6/8/24, 14:41 - HrishavSaha: So I call her sister or cousin😂
6/8/24, 14:41 - Purvi: 😂😂
6/8/24, 14:41 - HrishavSaha: She's roughly 2-3 years younger than me
6/8/24, 14:41 - HrishavSaha: And she's really nice
6/8/24, 14:41 - HrishavSaha: We don't really know much about each other in detail
6/8/24, 14:42 - Purvi: Ok nice
6/8/24, 14:42 - HrishavSaha: But
6/8/24, 14:42 - HrishavSaha: We just chat on WhatsApp
6/8/24, 14:42 - HrishavSaha: And compliment each other all day
6/8/24, 14:42 - HrishavSaha: 😂😂
6/8/24, 14:42 - Purvi: Weird but ok
6/8/24, 14:42 - HrishavSaha: Ikr?
6/8/24, 14:43 - HrishavSaha: But it's nice. Being validated by someone else
6/8/24, 14:43 - HrishavSaha: Ofcourse, it's not like we just exchange "you're nice" and "you're the best" all the time
6/8/24, 14:43 - HrishavSaha: We do talk about our day
6/8/24, 14:43 - HrishavSaha: But she's really sweet and polite
6/8/24, 14:44 - HrishavSaha: But her persona... God😂 she's tries to maintain this goth dominant vibe around her
6/8/24, 14:44 - Purvi: Oh
6/8/24, 14:44 - Purvi: Where did that come from
6/8/24, 14:45 - HrishavSaha: According to her, she's into kdrama, and likes the dominant office goth lady typa characters
6/8/24, 14:45 - HrishavSaha: So she decided to become one😂
6/8/24, 14:45 - Purvi: Icksss
6/8/24, 14:45 - HrishavSaha: Even went to gym to develop muscles
6/8/24, 14:45 - HrishavSaha: Either way
6/8/24, 14:46 - HrishavSaha: She doesn't really show that side to me, so idk how it is
6/8/24, 14:46 - Purvi: Okk
6/8/24, 14:46 - HrishavSaha: Mmhmm
6/8/24, 14:46 - HrishavSaha: You gonna ask? Or is it my turn?
6/8/24, 14:47 - Purvi: Ek Q
6/8/24, 14:47 - HrishavSaha: Go on
6/8/24, 14:47 - Purvi: What was your first impression about me?
6/8/24, 14:47 - HrishavSaha: 😂Oh boy
6/8/24, 14:48 - HrishavSaha: My FI about you was interesting
6/8/24, 14:48 - HrishavSaha: Remember that game we guys used to play?
6/8/24, 14:48 - HrishavSaha: Where we stand near pillars
6/8/24, 14:48 - HrishavSaha: And change positions, and one person has to catch us off the pillar?
6/8/24, 14:48 - Purvi: Yupp
6/8/24, 14:48 - Purvi: Corner corner
6/8/24, 14:48 - HrishavSaha: It's from around then
6/8/24, 14:48 - HrishavSaha: Ah yeah
6/8/24, 14:48 - HrishavSaha: I thought
6/8/24, 14:50 - HrishavSaha: 1. There could possibly no one more polite than you
2. You seemed like the shy kid who has an energetic side
3. Someone who I can tell my stuff to, if we ever get close enough. Trustworthy, in other words
6/8/24, 14:50 - Purvi: Ohhhh
6/8/24, 14:50 - Purvi: Really
6/8/24, 14:50 - HrishavSaha: Yeah
6/8/24, 14:50 - HrishavSaha: But I had zero idea I'd fall for you
6/8/24, 14:51 - HrishavSaha: Or that you were not as polite as I made you out to be😂
6/8/24, 14:51 - HrishavSaha: Idk the shy part
6/8/24, 14:51 - HrishavSaha: Other than all that, my FI was accurate, I guess
6/8/24, 14:51 - Purvi: That just leaves 3rd
6/8/24, 14:51 - Purvi: I am happy with it
6/8/24, 14:52 - HrishavSaha: It also leaves part of 2nd
6/8/24, 14:52 - HrishavSaha: You're energetic
6/8/24, 14:52 - HrishavSaha: Like
6/8/24, 14:52 - HrishavSaha: OTT
6/8/24, 14:52 - HrishavSaha: (over the top)
6/8/24, 14:52 - Purvi: Ohkk
6/8/24, 14:52 - Purvi: Ik
6/8/24, 14:52 - HrishavSaha: 😂
6/8/24, 14:52 - HrishavSaha: Oh
6/8/24, 14:52 - HrishavSaha: One more thing
6/8/24, 14:52 - HrishavSaha: I thought you were the studious type
6/8/24, 14:52 - HrishavSaha: Partially wrong there, eh? 😂
6/8/24, 14:53 - Purvi: Kinda😂😂
6/8/24, 14:53 - Purvi: But I study
6/8/24, 14:53 - HrishavSaha: Yeah
6/8/24, 14:53 - Purvi: You should see me school me
6/8/24, 14:53 - HrishavSaha: Hence, "partially"
6/8/24, 14:53 - HrishavSaha: I'd love to
6/8/24, 14:53 - Purvi: You cant💀
6/8/24, 14:54 - HrishavSaha: 😂Ofc I can't
6/8/24, 14:54 - Purvi: You wanna know my first impression
6/8/24, 14:54 - HrishavSaha: Sure
6/8/24, 14:54 - HrishavSaha: Tell me
6/8/24, 14:54 - Purvi: It was exactly how you are
6/8/24, 14:54 - Purvi: Except
6/8/24, 14:55 - Purvi: A little less gyani
6/8/24, 14:55 - HrishavSaha: 😂
6/8/24, 14:55 - Purvi: And I thought you will never hang out w me
6/8/24, 14:55 - HrishavSaha: Why is that?
6/8/24, 14:55 - Purvi: Cause you were older
6/8/24, 14:55 - Purvi: Idk why
6/8/24, 14:56 - HrishavSaha: Well, is reality better? Or worse?
6/8/24, 14:56 - Purvi: Obvi better
6/8/24, 14:56 - Purvi: Not the gyani part
6/8/24, 14:56 - HrishavSaha: You never would've guessed you're my favourite
6/8/24, 14:56 - HrishavSaha: 😂Cmon, it's a nice thing

6/8/24, 14:58 - HrishavSaha: That's the most I can compliment you rn
6/8/24, 14:58 - HrishavSaha: So take it
6/8/24, 14:58 - Purvi: You don't have to do that
6/8/24, 14:58 - Purvi: But thankssssss✨✨
6/8/24, 14:58 - HrishavSaha: I'm not doing it out of consideration for you
6/8/24, 14:58 - HrishavSaha: I compliment you or say stuff to you just because I want to
6/8/24, 14:59 - HrishavSaha: I'm more selfish than you might realise
6/8/24, 14:59 - Purvi: 💀😎✨✨
6/8/24, 14:59 - Purvi: Now you ask
6/8/24, 14:59 - HrishavSaha: Okay

6/8/24, 15:01 - HrishavSaha: That's a nice way to put it
6/8/24, 15:01 - HrishavSaha: I'm refraining from words like thanks and grateful since you asked me to
6/8/24, 15:01 - HrishavSaha: 😂
6/8/24, 15:01 - HrishavSaha: But
6/8/24, 15:01 - Purvi: 🤦🏻‍♀️
6/8/24, 15:01 - HrishavSaha: I feel really happy
6/8/24, 15:01 - Purvi: Ok
6/8/24, 15:02 - HrishavSaha: Not a lot of people call me theirs
6/8/24, 15:02 - HrishavSaha: So it's a special moment for me
6/8/24, 15:02 - HrishavSaha: Knowing someone considers me theirs
6/8/24, 15:03 - Purvi: Righttt
6/8/24, 15:03 - Purvi: Ik
6/8/24, 15:03 - Purvi: Idk what else to write

6/8/24, 15:04 - HrishavSaha: 😂
6/8/24, 15:04 - HrishavSaha: I do have my flaws😂

6/8/24, 15:05 - Purvi: Ikrrrrr
6/8/24, 15:05 - HrishavSaha: It's just that I'm good at hiding em
6/8/24, 15:05 - Purvi: Like what
6/8/24, 15:06 - HrishavSaha: I'm bad at expressing emotions
6/8/24, 15:06 - HrishavSaha: I'm really unstable. Emotionally
6/8/24, 15:06 - HrishavSaha: Most of my flaws are emotion related
6/8/24, 15:06 - HrishavSaha: 😂
6/8/24, 15:06 - HrishavSaha: I'm messed up in the head
6/8/24, 15:06 - Purvi: Ohkk
6/8/24, 15:07 - Purvi: Thats expected coming from a water element
6/8/24, 15:07 - HrishavSaha: Cuz water is turbulent?
6/8/24, 15:07 - Purvi: Kinda
6/8/24, 15:08 - HrishavSaha: Mmhmm
6/8/24, 15:08 - HrishavSaha: And you?
6/8/24, 15:08 - HrishavSaha: I mean, what's your element?
6/8/24, 15:08 - Purvi: Water
6/8/24, 15:08 - HrishavSaha: Do water and water mix well?
6/8/24, 15:09 - Purvi: What do you think
6/8/24, 15:09 - HrishavSaha: Scientifically, water is soluble in water, so... Yes, I guess?
6/8/24, 15:09 - Purvi: Exactly
6/8/24, 15:09 - HrishavSaha: I'll take it as a sign?
6/8/24, 15:10 - Purvi: Idk
6/8/24, 15:10 - Purvi: Now
6/8/24, 15:10 - Purvi: About me
6/8/24, 15:10 - HrishavSaha: Well, you're my woman. That goes without saying
6/8/24, 15:10 - HrishavSaha: Apart from that...
6/8/24, 15:11 - HrishavSaha: Remember you had scenarios in your head? About different stuff?
6/8/24, 15:11 - Purvi: Yupp
6/8/24, 15:11 - HrishavSaha: Well, I also had a few scenarios in my head
6/8/24, 15:11 - HrishavSaha: And some of em are related to you
6/8/24, 15:12 - HrishavSaha: Like when I'm back from abroad/college and I meet you again
6/8/24, 15:12 - HrishavSaha: Or when I take you with you on a trip. Just the two of us
6/8/24, 15:13 - HrishavSaha: Or when you confess your feelings to me... If that ever happens😅
6/8/24, 15:13 - Purvi: 😂😂
6/8/24, 15:13 - Purvi: Ohk that's nice
6/8/24, 15:13 - Purvi: Do you wanna tell me abt them
6/8/24, 15:14 - HrishavSaha: It's a secret
6/8/24, 15:14 - HrishavSaha: 😂
6/8/24, 15:14 - HrishavSaha: But in all seriousness
6/8/24, 15:14 - HrishavSaha: I could tell you
6/8/24, 15:14 - HrishavSaha: But
6/8/24, 15:14 - HrishavSaha: I want us to experience them, rather than just imagine them
6/8/24, 15:14 - HrishavSaha: So I won't spoil anything for you, and me, by telling you
6/8/24, 15:15 - Purvi: Ohkk
6/8/24, 15:15 - Purvi: I imagined that too
6/8/24, 15:15 - Purvi: We are kinda delulu for these
6/8/24, 15:16 - Purvi: But it's fine
6/8/24, 15:16 - HrishavSaha: 😂True
6/8/24, 15:16 - HrishavSaha: Yeah. This is a delusion I'm willing to drown in

6/8/24, 15:17 - HrishavSaha: 😂
6/8/24, 15:17 - HrishavSaha: You realise that the wording means you DO like me, but just won't admit it?
6/8/24, 15:18 - Purvi: Ya I didn't
6/8/24, 15:18 - HrishavSaha: Caught ya
6/8/24, 15:18 - Purvi: Anything else?
6/8/24, 15:19 - HrishavSaha: Any traumatic experience you wanna share?
6/8/24, 15:19 - HrishavSaha: It's alright if you don't
6/8/24, 15:19 - Purvi: I have never really had traumatic experience
6/8/24, 15:20 - HrishavSaha: That's rare. And fortunate
6/8/24, 15:20 - HrishavSaha: Really fortunate
6/8/24, 15:20 - Purvi: Thats rare?
6/8/24, 15:20 - Purvi: What abt you

6/8/24, 15:23 - HrishavSaha: That I'll make sure I'll take care of her
6/8/24, 15:23 - HrishavSaha: Well, we broke up
6/8/24, 15:23 - Purvi: 😂😂
6/8/24, 15:23 - HrishavSaha: But that won't stop me from fulfilling my promise
6/8/24, 15:24 - HrishavSaha: I'm perfectly content being her friend. But I'll make sure I'm always there for her in times of need
6/8/24, 15:24 - Purvi: Good

6/8/24, 18:06 - Purvi: Yupp
6/8/24, 18:06 - HrishavSaha: Well, thankfully it's not a rare occurrence
6/8/24, 18:06 - HrishavSaha: Indian parents are notorious for privacy invasion
6/8/24, 18:07 - Purvi: True that
6/8/24, 18:07 - Purvi: Do your parents check your phone
6/8/24, 18:07 - HrishavSaha: Not routinely
6/8/24, 18:07 - HrishavSaha: But if they smell anything sus
6/8/24, 18:07 - HrishavSaha: They'll dismantle my phone if they have to

6/8/24, 18:09 - Purvi: But she loves me the most
6/8/24, 18:09 - Purvi: Cause I am the oldest
6/8/24, 18:10 - HrishavSaha: Not because you're you?
6/8/24, 18:10 - Purvi: Maybe
6/8/24, 18:10 - Purvi: Idk
6/8/24, 18:10 - Purvi: But mostly cause am the oldest
6/8/24, 18:10 - HrishavSaha: Why don't you like her? Any specific reason?
6/8/24, 18:11 - Purvi: She was just extremely toxic towards dada
6/8/24, 18:11 - Purvi: And papa mamma
6/8/24, 18:11 - Purvi: And Chachi chacha

6/8/24, 18:11 - HrishavSaha: It's my paternal grandparents
6/8/24, 18:12 - HrishavSaha: Toxic, greedy, manipulative (terrible at it, but anyway)
6/8/24, 18:12 - Purvi: I hated her the most
6/8/24, 18:12 - Purvi: Bc
6/8/24, 18:12 - Purvi: When my dada died
6/8/24, 18:12 - Purvi: She was literally
6/8/24, 18:13 - Purvi: Gossiping and laughing the next day
6/8/24, 18:13 - Purvi: Like whattttt!?!!??
6/8/24, 18:13 - HrishavSaha: That's... More messed up than "messed up"
6/8/24, 18:13 - Purvi: And when he was sick
6/8/24, 18:13 - Purvi: She would find every excuse to not sleep with him
6/8/24, 18:14 - Purvi: Cause sometimes he needed water and stuff
6/8/24, 18:14 - Purvi: And needed some help getting up
6/8/24, 18:14 - HrishavSaha: Lmao

6/8/24, 18:14 - HrishavSaha: Okay
6/8/24, 18:14 - HrishavSaha: I take back the "I can relate"
6/8/24, 18:15 - HrishavSaha: My paternal grandparents have been extremely bad, toxic and stuff
6/8/24, 18:15 - HrishavSaha: But they've never done anything this messed up (to my knowledge)
6/8/24, 18:16 - Purvi: I guess she is trying to be better now
6/8/24, 18:16 - HrishavSaha: And do you think she deserves a chance?
6/8/24, 18:16 - Purvi: Nope
6/8/24, 18:16 - HrishavSaha: I agree with you
6/8/24, 18:17 - Purvi: I mean mere dada was such a good person
6/8/24, 18:17 - Purvi: And when he needed her the most she was gone
6/8/24, 18:18 - HrishavSaha: My grandparents have misbehaved with my mother (cuz it was a love marriage), refused to allow my dad to study for btech (cuz it was a "waste of money") and even demanded the money with which I was gonna be admitted into kindergarten
6/8/24, 18:18 - Purvi: Shittt yarr
6/8/24, 18:18 - HrishavSaha: And I don't forgive them just for this
6/8/24, 18:18 - HrishavSaha: You've got a more messed up story
6/8/24, 18:19 - HrishavSaha: And you know the reality?
6/8/24, 18:19 - Purvi: Thats the story I have heard through mamma papa ke calls and stuff
6/8/24, 18:19 - HrishavSaha: I don't even feel angry towards them. Feels like a waste of energy.

6/10/24, 15:53 - HrishavSaha: But apparently that hotel overrided all our bookings and was full
6/10/24, 15:53 - HrishavSaha: So we contacted management

6/13/24, 11:45 - HrishavSaha: You should be studying
6/13/24, 11:45 - Purvi: We dont usually go that often
6/13/24, 11:46 - Purvi: once rarely
6/13/24, 11:46 - HrishavSaha: Well, you don't sound onboard with the idea
6/13/24, 11:46 - HrishavSaha: Wouldn't be calling it bad news otherwise
6/13/24, 11:46 - Purvi: I really dont wanna go
6/13/24, 11:46 - HrishavSaha: Then tell your mom
6/13/24, 11:46 - Purvi: It is sooooooooooooooo boring
6/13/24, 11:46 - HrishavSaha: That you need to study
6/13/24, 11:46 - HrishavSaha: That it's boring
6/13/24, 11:46 - Purvi: told her na
6/13/24, 11:46 - HrishavSaha: And you also have an exam on Saturday
6/13/24, 11:47 - Purvi: she said if the maid will stay night mein and cook hen I cany stay
6/13/24, 11:47 - Purvi: turns out she is taking holiday
6/13/24, 11:47 - Purvi: for exactly that amount of time
6/13/24, 11:47 - HrishavSaha: Great
6/13/24, 11:48 - HrishavSaha: Well
6/13/24, 11:48 - HrishavSaha: It's just three days, right?
6/13/24, 11:48 - HrishavSaha: You could just have your mom cook 3 days worth of food for you?
6/13/24, 11:48 - HrishavSaha: That's what I did once. For an entire week, that too
6/13/24, 11:49 - Purvi: No one stayed with you?
6/13/24, 11:49 - HrishavSaha: Nope
6/13/24, 11:50 - Purvi: mumma ko already maie bohot baaar convience karne ka try kiya
6/13/24, 11:50 - Purvi: yk what she said
6/13/24, 11:50 - Purvi: I can stay at my bhua's place
6/13/24, 11:50 - Purvi: she lives like 40 mins away
6/13/24, 11:50 - Purvi: Like whats the point then
6/13/24, 11:51 - HrishavSaha: Yeah
6/13/24, 11:51 - HrishavSaha: Either way
6/13/24, 11:51 - HrishavSaha: Whatever your plan of action is
6/13/24, 11:51 - HrishavSaha: From an academic perspective, you're going to suffer
6/13/24, 11:51 - HrishavSaha: You can already see that diva is ahead of you by almost two exercises now
6/13/24, 11:52 - HrishavSaha: You go for three days, she'll be ahead by a chapter
6/13/24, 11:52 - HrishavSaha: Tell your mom this
6/13/24, 11:52 - Purvi: ik ik
6/13/24, 11:53 - HrishavSaha: Your entire study schedule will be messed up, and you know that yourself
6/13/24, 11:53 - HrishavSaha: After that, it's your call
6/13/24, 14:11 - HrishavSaha: Hi
6/13/24, 14:41 - Purvi: Hiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiieeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
6/13/24, 14:42 - HrishavSaha: Busy?
6/13/24, 14:42 - Purvi: Nopeeee
6/13/24, 14:42 - HrishavSaha: Can I have a hug?
6/13/24, 14:43 - Purvi: shoreeeeeee
6/13/24, 14:43 - HrishavSaha: Can you come out? Don't ring the bell
6/13/24, 14:44 - Purvi: what happened?
6/13/24, 14:44 - HrishavSaha: My mom happened
6/13/24, 14:44 - HrishavSaha: That's what
6/13/24, 14:45 - HrishavSaha: We were casually chatting and I made the terrible mistake of telling her that diva's mom scolded us when we asked for Diva to join us to the club
6/13/24, 14:45 - HrishavSaha: Well, now she's basically declared house arrest on me, and I'm not allowed to continue tuitions
6/13/24, 14:45 - Purvi: whatttttttttttt
6/13/24, 14:45 - Purvi: the hellllllllllllllllllllllllllllllll
6/13/24, 14:45 - HrishavSaha: Thought you guys should know, because it does concern you two
6/13/24, 14:46 - Purvi: wtfffffffffff
6/13/24, 14:46 - Purvi: bruhhhhhhh
6/13/24, 14:46 - HrishavSaha: Yeah
6/13/24, 14:46 - Purvi: why was that a prob exactly
6/13/24, 14:46 - Purvi: she scoled us bc of the dhoop na
6/13/24, 14:47 - HrishavSaha: She took the "tumhare mummy papa daat te nahi hein" personally
6/13/24, 14:47 - Purvi: no offense
6/13/24, 14:47 - Purvi: stupid reason
6/13/24, 14:48 - HrishavSaha: Not to mention the time diva's mom blatantly said all the movie night plan was all mine
6/13/24, 14:48 - Purvi: is she serious?!?
6/13/24, 14:48 - HrishavSaha: None taken
6/13/24, 14:48 - HrishavSaha: Indeed
6/13/24, 14:48 - HrishavSaha: I know her when she's serious. This is one of em
6/13/24, 14:48 - Purvi: wthhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
6/13/24, 14:49 - HrishavSaha: Says that diva's mom's words raises a question on the quality of discipline she's provided me
6/13/24, 14:49 - Purvi: didnt you tell her she was seriously unserious
6/13/24, 14:49 - Purvi: and was laughing while saying that
6/13/24, 14:49 - HrishavSaha: As if that'd make any difference
6/13/24, 14:50 - HrishavSaha: She also made that movie night accusation "jokingly"
6/13/24, 14:50 - HrishavSaha: Did that change anything? Nope
6/13/24, 14:50 - Purvi: wtfffffffffffffff
6/13/24, 14:50 - HrishavSaha: It's diva's mom who needs control over what the hell she says
6/13/24, 14:50 - Purvi: she does
6/13/24, 14:50 - HrishavSaha: But I can't say that, to diva or her mom, can I?
6/13/24, 14:51 - Purvi: but dono ki galti he yarrrr
6/13/24, 14:51 - Purvi: lest do it
6/13/24, 14:51 - Purvi: lets confront her
6/13/24, 14:51 - Purvi: with aunty
6/13/24, 14:51 - HrishavSaha: Well, my mom is pretty good at dramatising stuff. That's nothing new
6/13/24, 14:51 - HrishavSaha: Yeah, and mess up even more
6/13/24, 14:51 - HrishavSaha: I wish
6/13/24, 14:52 - HrishavSaha: You do that, you know what will happen?
6/13/24, 14:52 - Purvi: tell diva na
6/13/24, 14:52 - HrishavSaha: Strained relations within the society, Diva will probably stop coming to tuition, her mom will further dramatise and emphasize on my lack of discipline
6/13/24, 14:52 - Purvi: I dont think her parents will be ok with no tution wala part
6/13/24, 14:53 - HrishavSaha: How do I? She doesn't have a phone, and I don't trust that family enough to not use texts as proof
6/13/24, 14:53 - HrishavSaha: And I'm on house arrest
6/13/24, 14:53 - Purvi: Should I tell mumma
6/13/24, 14:53 - Purvi: I think she can convience aunty
6/13/24, 14:54 - HrishavSaha: I'll tell you what to say
6/13/24, 14:54 - HrishavSaha: Not the entire thing
6/13/24, 14:54 - HrishavSaha: That'll just get me in more trouble
6/13/24, 14:54 - HrishavSaha: Here's the version I officially am telling you
6/13/24, 14:54 - Purvi: jaldiiiiiiiiiii
6/13/24, 14:56 - HrishavSaha: Due to certain interactions with diva's mom (including her accusation), I (not my mom) felt attacked personally and due to the self respect I possess, I'm gonna quit going outside my home AND tuitions, before such matters become more difficult to handle or blow out of proportions
6/13/24, 14:56 - HrishavSaha: Yeah, this is what you know, nothing else
6/13/24, 14:57 - HrishavSaha: And the reason I'm telling you is because the matter concerns you two
6/13/24, 14:58 - HrishavSaha: Pass on the exact information to diva as well, if you can. Not over any written format though
6/13/24, 14:58 - Purvi: waittttttttt
6/13/24, 14:58 - Purvi: srry
6/13/24, 14:58 - HrishavSaha: What for?
6/13/24, 14:58 - Purvi: maine thoda sa aunty wala part bata diya
6/13/24, 14:58 - HrishavSaha: How much did you say?
6/13/24, 14:58 - Purvi: bc I thinkshe can talk to your mom
6/13/24, 14:59 - Purvi: I said that she is quite upset bc aunty ne aisa bola and she will not alloe you
6/13/24, 14:59 - HrishavSaha: Fine, that's fine
6/13/24, 14:59 - HrishavSaha: Include the self respect part too
6/13/24, 15:00 - HrishavSaha: That I agree with my mom
6/13/24, 15:00 - Purvi: she said ki she will talk to aunty and the tutions will continue
6/13/24, 15:00 - Purvi: yeah I did
6/13/24, 15:00 - HrishavSaha: Otherwise, I'll be the one facing backlash at home. "so you don't have any self respect of your own, huh?"
6/13/24, 15:00 - HrishavSaha: Alright
6/13/24, 15:01 - HrishavSaha: Inform diva too once you can
6/13/24, 15:01 - HrishavSaha: It's important she knows it
6/13/24, 15:01 - Purvi: baarish mein mood kharab kar diya yaarrrr
6/13/24, 15:01 - HrishavSaha: I didn't mean to. Sorry
6/13/24, 15:01 - HrishavSaha: Just wanted a hug
6/13/24, 15:01 - Purvi: still want it?
6/13/24, 15:02 - HrishavSaha: Yeah...
6/13/24, 15:02 - HrishavSaha: You can't really come outside though, can you?
6/13/24, 15:02 - Purvi: 5 min wait
6/13/24, 15:02 - Purvi: I will when mumma goes upstairs
6/13/24, 15:03 - HrishavSaha: Is it a friend fulfilling a favour? Or a girlfriend fulfilling a wish?
6/13/24, 15:03 - Purvi: Does it matter
6/13/24, 15:03 - HrishavSaha: Not really
6/13/24, 15:03 - Purvi: mhmmm
6/13/24, 15:04 - HrishavSaha: ♥️
6/13/24, 15:12 - Purvi: sunooooooooo

6/13/24, 16:49 - HrishavSaha: Sometimes, it feels like I've known you for a very long time
6/13/24, 16:49 - Purvi: ikr
6/13/24, 16:50 - HrishavSaha: You believe in the "made for each other" stuff?

6/13/24, 16:50 - HrishavSaha: None taken

6/13/24, 16:51 - HrishavSaha: But it does go to show that we worked to be together
6/13/24, 16:51 - HrishavSaha: To be where we are now
6/13/24, 16:51 - Purvi: yeah it does
6/13/24, 16:52 - HrishavSaha: And I'm much more excited for all the stuff we'll discover along the way, together

6/13/24, 18:19 - HrishavSaha: Yeah
6/13/24, 18:20 - HrishavSaha: About that
6/13/24, 18:20 - HrishavSaha: Ban has been lifted
6/13/24, 18:20 - Purvi: 😂😂
6/13/24, 18:20 - HrishavSaha: But
6/13/24, 18:20 - Purvi: how
6/13/24, 18:20 - Purvi: I told you she isnt serious
6/13/24, 18:20 - HrishavSaha: This was serious, purvi
6/13/24, 18:20 - Purvi: not grounded anymore
6/13/24, 18:21 - HrishavSaha: She did say that she wasn't serious about the not teaching part
6/13/24, 18:21 - HrishavSaha: But she was genuinely mad at diva's mom. Not was. She still is
6/13/24, 18:21 - HrishavSaha: That part is very kuch true
6/13/24, 18:21 - HrishavSaha: Much*
6/13/24, 18:21 - Purvi: ohhk

6/13/24, 18:21 - Purvi: ...
6/13/24, 18:22 - HrishavSaha: Had a convo with her
6/13/24, 18:23 - HrishavSaha: Told her that i told her like I would to a friend. That her reaction only served to discourage me from telling her everything
6/13/24, 18:23 - HrishavSaha: Well, I quickly got corrected with her own justification, but atleast the ban is lifted and I'm happy
6/13/24, 18:23 - Purvi: ohhhh nicee effectiveee
6/13/24, 18:23 - Purvi: yeah jk
6/13/24, 18:23 - HrishavSaha: Anyway

6/13/24, 18:25 - Purvi: oh ha
6/13/24, 18:25 - Purvi: abhi should I go?
6/13/24, 18:25 - HrishavSaha: And I'd like to spend some alone time with you
6/13/24, 18:25 - HrishavSaha: Nah, screw it
6/13/24, 18:26 - HrishavSaha: You don't have to GO to her house
6/13/24, 18:26 - HrishavSaha: That's a layer of complication
6/13/24, 18:26 - Purvi: mamma gave me the permission that I can go to the clubhouse with you
6/13/24, 18:26 - HrishavSaha: Woah
6/13/24, 18:26 - Purvi: But
6/13/24, 18:27 - HrishavSaha: But?
6/13/24, 18:27 - Purvi: yeah no buts
6/13/24, 18:27 - Purvi: just took a lot of conveincing
6/13/24, 18:27 - Purvi: and giving examples of other ppl

6/13/24, 21:57 - HrishavSaha: Nothing specific
6/13/24, 21:57 - HrishavSaha: Some alone time, that's all
6/13/24, 21:57 - Purvi: ohk

6/13/24, 22:28 - Purvi: Mein jabse class se aai hu mumma mujhse sabke grids banwa rhi he
6/13/24, 22:28 - Purvi: She is obsessed 😂😂💀
6/13/24, 22:28 - HrishavSaha: 😂😂
6/13/24, 22:28 - HrishavSaha: It's nice to have someone who's enthusiastic about something you're good at
6/13/24, 22:29 - Purvi: It is
6/13/24, 22:29 - HrishavSaha: Quick question
6/13/24, 22:29 - HrishavSaha: How did you convince your mom? Regarding the club?
6/13/24, 22:29 - Purvi: I guilt trapped her
6/13/24, 22:29 - Purvi: 😂😂💀
6/13/24, 22:29 - HrishavSaha: 😂💀
6/13/24, 22:30 - Purvi: See
6/13/24, 22:30 - Purvi: So I just gave the examples of my cousins and how my mami is chill
6/13/24, 22:30 - Purvi: Then I convienced her you are like my brother
6/13/24, 22:31 - HrishavSaha: 😂Knew it
6/13/24, 22:31 - HrishavSaha: So she had her doubts about our relationship all along
6/13/24, 22:31 - Purvi: And then I said stuff like you don't trust me or what
6/13/24, 22:31 - Purvi: And then cherry on top maine unki bohot tareef kari😎😎
6/13/24, 22:31 - HrishavSaha: 😂😂😂
6/13/24, 22:32 - HrishavSaha: Well, whatever magic you did, it worked
6/13/24, 22:32 - HrishavSaha: I do feel a little bad about you lying about me being like your brother stuff
6/13/24, 22:32 - HrishavSaha: Sorry I had make you go through that
6/13/24, 22:33 - Purvi: It's fine
6/13/24, 22:33 - HrishavSaha: When will you be leaving tomorrow?
6/13/24, 22:33 - Purvi: 12
6/13/24, 22:33 - HrishavSaha: So you coming for swimming?
6/13/24, 22:34 - Purvi: Yupp
6/13/24, 22:34 - HrishavSaha: Cool
6/13/24, 22:34 - HrishavSaha: Atleast I get to be with you for some more time
6/13/24, 22:34 - Purvi: Sameee yarr
6/13/24, 22:34 - HrishavSaha: What's your mom's impression of me, at this stage?
6/13/24, 22:35 - Purvi: She is still a Lil sus
6/13/24, 22:35 - HrishavSaha: 😂
6/13/24, 22:35 - Purvi: And you being non vegetarian doesn't 😂😂💀help
6/13/24, 22:35 - Purvi: Idk why that's imp
6/13/24, 22:36 - HrishavSaha: Yeah, that😂
6/13/24, 22:36 - Purvi: But apparently it is
6/13/24, 22:36 - HrishavSaha: Well, people like to stick to stuff they're familiar with. And it's human to reject change
6/13/24, 22:36 - Purvi: And yk starting mein that pocket money wala cheez
6/13/24, 22:37 - HrishavSaha: Same reason why we'd pick one particular flavour of chips over and over again
6/13/24, 22:37 - HrishavSaha: Yeah?
6/13/24, 22:37 - Purvi: I didn't tell you that
6/13/24, 22:38 - Purvi: But mumma said ki how can someone say this
6/13/24, 22:38 - Purvi: Yk unka parenting skills felt attacked😂😂
6/13/24, 22:38 - Purvi: But she got over it
6/13/24, 22:38 - Purvi: Not a big deal
6/13/24, 22:38 - HrishavSaha: 😅
6/13/24, 22:38 - Purvi: What abt aunty?
6/13/24, 22:38 - HrishavSaha: Her impression of you?
6/13/24, 22:39 - Purvi: Yupp
6/13/24, 22:39 - HrishavSaha: Well
6/13/24, 22:39 - Purvi: I think she doesn't think I am a bi anymore
6/13/24, 22:39 - HrishavSaha: She's partly, indirectly responsible for us kissing each other nowadays
6/13/24, 22:39 - HrishavSaha: 😂
6/13/24, 22:39 - HrishavSaha: She never knew you were Bi in the first place
6/13/24, 22:40 - Purvi: Bad influence stupid
6/13/24, 22:40 - HrishavSaha: Ah
6/13/24, 22:40 - HrishavSaha: Well well
6/13/24, 22:40 - HrishavSaha: One step at a time
6/13/24, 22:40 - HrishavSaha: First of all
6/13/24, 22:40 - HrishavSaha: Remember I once asked you
6/13/24, 22:40 - HrishavSaha: If you liked me?
6/13/24, 22:40 - HrishavSaha: And I had to apologize to you?
6/13/24, 22:40 - Purvi: Yupp
6/13/24, 22:41 - HrishavSaha: Truthfully though
6/13/24, 22:41 - HrishavSaha: You really didn't like me back then?
6/13/24, 22:41 - Purvi: Nhi I didn't
6/13/24, 22:41 - HrishavSaha: Alright
6/13/24, 22:41 - HrishavSaha: Anyway
6/13/24, 22:41 - HrishavSaha: The reason I asked you was because my mom was sus that you like me
6/13/24, 22:42 - HrishavSaha: And that was actually the push that made me realise I unknowingly had feelings for you
6/13/24, 22:42 - HrishavSaha: Then
6/13/24, 22:42 - HrishavSaha: She never really thought anything bad of you, actually
6/13/24, 22:43 - HrishavSaha: Except that you have a tendency to go wild with your spontaneous plans
6/13/24, 22:43 - HrishavSaha: Until... You told me to shut the fuck up in front of hee
6/13/24, 22:43 - HrishavSaha: Her*
6/13/24, 22:43 - HrishavSaha: Yeah
6/13/24, 22:43 - HrishavSaha: That put a BIG stain on your otherwise relatively clean track record
6/13/24, 22:44 - Purvi: I think I covered it up
6/13/24, 22:44 - HrishavSaha: Well, you did
6/13/24, 22:44 - HrishavSaha: You did what you could
6/13/24, 22:44 - HrishavSaha: You apologised
6/13/24, 22:44 - HrishavSaha: And you're fixing your control over cuss words
6/13/24, 22:44 - Purvi: Aunty has apologised to me bc of that many time since then
6/13/24, 22:45 - HrishavSaha: Well
6/13/24, 22:45 - HrishavSaha: She won't fake an apology
6/13/24, 22:45 - HrishavSaha: So her apologies were genuine
6/13/24, 22:45 - HrishavSaha: But she still has a guard up against you
6/13/24, 22:45 - HrishavSaha: Although your efforts have lowered it a bit lately
6/13/24, 22:45 - Purvi: Good
6/13/24, 22:46 - HrishavSaha: It'll take a bit more time to get yourself in my mom's good book, but keep up the good work
6/13/24, 22:46 - HrishavSaha: You're 20% there
6/13/24, 22:46 - Purvi: You didnt tell aunty about your abhi wala ex did you
6/13/24, 22:46 - HrishavSaha: Nah
6/13/24, 22:46 - Purvi: Not half bad 😎
6/13/24, 22:46 - Purvi: Why
6/13/24, 22:46 - HrishavSaha: Yep
6/13/24, 22:47 - HrishavSaha: Want me to live on the streets?
6/13/24, 22:47 - Purvi: I thought she was okay with you dating
6/13/24, 22:47 - HrishavSaha: Welllll
6/13/24, 22:47 - HrishavSaha: It's complicated
6/13/24, 22:47 - HrishavSaha: I'll tell you the story
6/13/24, 22:47 - HrishavSaha: I trust you
6/13/24, 22:47 - HrishavSaha: So, well
6/13/24, 22:48 - HrishavSaha: Back when I was in Chennai
6/13/24, 22:48 - HrishavSaha: There was a complication
6/13/24, 22:48 - HrishavSaha: On the morning after my bday last year
6/13/24, 22:48 - HrishavSaha: A girl from my school, but different batch and class texted me
6/13/24, 22:48 - HrishavSaha: On insta
6/13/24, 22:49 - HrishavSaha: Never spoke to her before
6/13/24, 22:49 - HrishavSaha: But anyway, she wished me happy birthday
6/13/24, 22:49 - HrishavSaha: And we spoke for 10 minutes or so
6/13/24, 22:49 - HrishavSaha: Towards the end, I casually asked her, "so where do ya live?"
6/13/24, 22:50 - HrishavSaha: To make sure I didn't sound offensive, I even followed up with a "it's okay if you don't wanna say"
6/13/24, 22:50 - HrishavSaha: Regardless, after a moment of hesitation, she told me
6/13/24, 22:50 - HrishavSaha: So I said, "Oh, that's near where I live"
6/13/24, 22:50 - HrishavSaha: And then casually ended the convo and went about my day
6/13/24, 22:50 - HrishavSaha: Next day, I took a leave from school
6/13/24, 22:51 - HrishavSaha: The next day, I went
6/13/24, 22:51 - HrishavSaha: And my classmates were telling me some girl from some other class was looking for me yesterday
6/13/24, 22:51 - HrishavSaha: I didn't pay it much heed
6/13/24, 22:52 - HrishavSaha: Later, over the course of a week, I got to hear whispers and rumours of me harassing a girl over insta
6/13/24, 22:52 - HrishavSaha: That I forced a girl into giving up her address and that I told her that I'll come to her home, despite her saying no
6/13/24, 22:53 - HrishavSaha: Once the matter got to the principle, you know how it goes
6/13/24, 22:53 - Purvi: Wthhh
6/13/24, 22:53 - HrishavSaha: I'm a guy. Society doesn't like guys. The principle gave me a solid lecture before I was even allowed to speak
6/13/24, 22:53 - HrishavSaha: I decided to show them the detailed chat
6/13/24, 22:53 - HrishavSaha: That should've saved me, right?
6/13/24, 22:53 - HrishavSaha: Wrong
6/13/24, 22:54 - HrishavSaha: The girl just said, "I deleted the entire chat cuz I was afraid of him. He must've deleted some texts selectively to prove his innocence"
6/13/24, 22:55 - Purvi: Why did she do that
6/13/24, 22:55 - HrishavSaha: I still have no clue
6/13/24, 22:55 - HrishavSaha: She basically ruined my life
6/13/24, 22:55 - HrishavSaha: The principal gave me two options, to either shift to another branch, or stay in the same branch
6/13/24, 22:56 - HrishavSaha: I decided to stay. Life was hellish, purvi. Pure hell. The not-so-silent whispers were constant. "he's the one". "it's him".
6/13/24, 22:57 - Purvi: Fuckkkkkkkkkkk
6/13/24, 22:57 - HrishavSaha: Thankfully, my dad got a job transfer just a month later, and we shifted to Jaipur
6/13/24, 22:57 - HrishavSaha: To me, it felt more like I was running away
6/13/24, 22:57 - HrishavSaha: And I'm sure some people still believe that I ran away
6/13/24, 22:57 - HrishavSaha: So there you have it
6/13/24, 22:58 - HrishavSaha: The reason why I am reluctant around girls in general
6/13/24, 22:58 - HrishavSaha: The reason why I always insist on having a parent accompany us if I'm going somewhere with you guys
6/13/24, 22:59 - HrishavSaha: I'm not saying you guys will do the same, but there's no guarantee someone won't, and misunderstandings are all too easy to conjure
6/13/24, 22:59 - Purvi: Mhmmm fills the gaps
6/13/24, 23:00 - HrishavSaha: I doubt anyone in Chennai believes I didn't do that stuff, especially after I "ran away"
6/13/24, 23:00 - Purvi: I kinda get why you were so upset abt the movie night incident
6/13/24, 23:00 - HrishavSaha: Yeah
6/13/24, 23:00 - Purvi: It's finee
6/13/24, 23:00 - Purvi: You are probably never going to meet them again
6/13/24, 23:00 - HrishavSaha: That accusation from diva's mom... It brought back painful memories
6/13/24, 23:00 - HrishavSaha: There's no "probably". I AM never going to meet em
6/13/24, 23:01 - HrishavSaha: I'm never setting foot in Chennai again, for that matter
6/13/24, 23:01 - HrishavSaha: I just say that I'll get into IIT Chennai, for my parents sake
6/13/24, 23:01 - HrishavSaha: But I'll get into IIT Mumbai or delhi
6/13/24, 23:01 - Purvi: So you ll not go to Chennai bc of that incident
6/13/24, 23:02 - HrishavSaha: Yeah
6/13/24, 23:02 - Purvi: No wayy you are doing that
6/13/24, 23:02 - HrishavSaha: I can't deal with south India in general
6/13/24, 23:02 - HrishavSaha: They're way too conservative
6/13/24, 23:02 - HrishavSaha: Even complimenting a girl's dress nowadays feels like I'm saying "wish I could tear that dress apart and eat you up"
6/13/24, 23:03 - Purvi: Woah woah
6/13/24, 23:03 - Purvi: K
6/13/24, 23:03 - Purvi: Chill
6/13/24, 23:03 - Purvi: Not that deep
6/13/24, 23:03 - HrishavSaha: It was bad, purvi
6/13/24, 23:03 - HrishavSaha: Chennai is such a nice place
6/13/24, 23:03 - Purvi: It was
6/13/24, 23:03 - Purvi: Was
6/13/24, 23:03 - HrishavSaha: But the people there?
6/13/24, 23:04 - HrishavSaha: Narrow minded, overly conservative pricks
6/13/24, 23:04 - Purvi: Really
6/13/24, 23:04 - HrishavSaha: Yes
6/13/24, 23:04 - HrishavSaha: It's safer there, compared to north
6/13/24, 23:04 - Purvi: But I guess collage will be diff their yk
6/13/24, 23:04 - HrishavSaha: Guys don't stare at girls
6/13/24, 23:04 - Purvi: Ppl from diff states
6/13/24, 23:05 - HrishavSaha: And that's good. But say you compliment a classmate, and boom, you're a sex offender
6/13/24, 23:05 - HrishavSaha: Idk. I don't care
6/13/24, 23:05 - HrishavSaha: I'm not going back there
6/13/24, 23:05 - HrishavSaha: It's tough without knowing their language anyway
6/13/24, 23:06 - HrishavSaha: I'll probably get into IIT delhi
6/13/24, 23:06 - HrishavSaha: Stay in the hostel
6/13/24, 23:06 - HrishavSaha: Visit Jaipur, my family, and you, over the weekend
6/13/24, 23:06 - HrishavSaha: It's for the best
6/13/24, 23:07 - Purvi: That sounds good
6/13/24, 23:07 - Purvi: But
6/13/24, 23:07 - Purvi: You should consider rethinking
6/13/24, 23:07 - Purvi: And
6/13/24, 23:07 - Purvi: Yk what we should do
6/13/24, 23:08 - Purvi: I mean it's been a while I can probably message that girl and ask why she did that
6/13/24, 23:08 - Purvi: I wanna know
6/13/24, 23:08 - HrishavSaha: No
6/13/24, 23:08 - HrishavSaha: Their logic won't make sense anyway
6/13/24, 23:08 - Purvi: Ok I ll not
6/13/24, 23:08 - Purvi: At least a prank
6/13/24, 23:08 - Purvi: Pls
6/13/24, 23:09 - Purvi: A bura one
6/13/24, 23:09 - HrishavSaha: Purvi
6/13/24, 23:09 - HrishavSaha: I wanna leave behind the last 5 years of my life
6/13/24, 23:09 - HrishavSaha: I've been recovering
6/13/24, 23:09 - Purvi: But She was such a jerkkk
6/13/24, 23:10 - HrishavSaha: I don't wanna dive deeper into the shit I'm trying to escape from
6/13/24, 23:10 - Purvi: Yeah I guess
6/13/24, 23:10 - HrishavSaha: I have you
6/13/24, 23:10 - HrishavSaha: That's all that matters
6/13/24, 23:10 - HrishavSaha: You're all I care about
6/13/24, 23:11 - HrishavSaha: Maybe it was meant to be, so I could meet you
6/13/24, 23:11 - HrishavSaha: Have 5 students
6/13/24, 23:11 - HrishavSaha: Get more social interaction
6/13/24, 23:11 - HrishavSaha: It's a heavy price to pay, your own self respect and dignity, and it's not something I'd pay knowingly
6/13/24, 23:11 - HrishavSaha: But what's done is done
6/13/24, 23:12 - HrishavSaha: Can't change it
6/13/24, 23:12 - HrishavSaha: I just wanna focus on you
6/13/24, 23:12 - HrishavSaha: And my 12th
6/13/24, 23:12 - Purvi: Yeah true
6/13/24, 23:12 - HrishavSaha: I love you, purvi
6/13/24, 23:13 - Purvi: I love you too
6/13/24, 23:13 - Purvi: I always will
6/13/24, 23:13 - HrishavSaha: Me too♥️
6/13/24, 23:13 - Purvi: Godd that was baddd
6/13/24, 23:13 - Purvi: This whole thing
6/13/24, 23:13 - Purvi: Anyways
6/13/24, 23:14 - HrishavSaha: This is the reason why my parents are wary of me being around girls
6/13/24, 23:14 - HrishavSaha: And dating has become a pretty big no no for me, besides 12th
6/13/24, 23:15 - HrishavSaha: And that's the actual reason I'm not allowed to use insta. Initially, my account was slated for deletion, but then my parents told me I could use it after 12th
6/13/24, 23:15 - Purvi: Righttt
6/13/24, 23:15 - HrishavSaha: Even my laptop was taken away from a whole month
6/13/24, 23:15 - HrishavSaha: But I don't really care about that
6/13/24, 23:16 - HrishavSaha: Do you know what the principal told me, the moment I entered his office?
6/13/24, 23:16 - HrishavSaha: "I'd beat you up first, then speak to you. But I'm making an exception since you're an academically gifted student"
6/13/24, 23:17 - Purvi: Oh myyy godddddddd
6/13/24, 23:17 - Purvi: The audacityyyy
6/13/24, 23:17 - Purvi: Mannnnn
6/13/24, 23:17 - HrishavSaha: Yeah, well
6/13/24, 23:18 - HrishavSaha: Imagine respecting a guy for almost an entire year
6/13/24, 23:18 - HrishavSaha: Only to hear such words from him
6/13/24, 23:19 - Purvi: Thats messed up
6/13/24, 23:19 - Purvi: Yeah
6/13/24, 23:19 - HrishavSaha: Haha, it sure is
6/13/24, 23:19 - HrishavSaha: Anyway
6/13/24, 23:19 - HrishavSaha: That's enough cold water
6/13/24, 23:19 - HrishavSaha: Tell me something about you
6/13/24, 23:19 - HrishavSaha: Anything
6/13/24, 23:20 - Purvi: Be specific
6/13/24, 23:20 - HrishavSaha: Just tell me whatever comes to your mind
6/13/24, 23:20 - HrishavSaha: Alright fine
6/13/24, 23:20 - HrishavSaha: I'll give you a question
6/13/24, 23:21 - HrishavSaha: Though beware, I'm narcissistic
6/13/24, 23:21 - HrishavSaha: Anyway
6/13/24, 23:21 - HrishavSaha: What do you think when you look at me?
6/13/24, 23:21 - Purvi: Tbh I dont

6/13/24, 23:22 - HrishavSaha: 😂
6/13/24, 23:22 - HrishavSaha: Then what do you think of me when you're NOT looking at me?
6/13/24, 23:23 - Purvi: Idk
6/13/24, 23:23 - Purvi: I just think
6/13/24, 23:24 - Purvi: And then I forget
6/13/24, 23:24 - Purvi: 💀
6/13/24, 23:24 - Purvi: But you do look good
6/13/24, 23:24 - HrishavSaha: I'll take that, thanks
6/13/24, 23:24 - Purvi: I don't have proper ans
6/13/24, 23:24 - HrishavSaha: You love me a lot, don't you?
6/13/24, 23:25 - Purvi: What do you think
6/13/24, 23:25 - Purvi: Nhi what do you think
6/13/24, 23:25 - HrishavSaha: Don't need one. The way you behave with me is enough

6/13/24, 23:25 - HrishavSaha: I think
6/13/24, 23:25 - HrishavSaha: You love me a lot

6/13/24, 23:29 - HrishavSaha: 1. I'm looking for ways to hold your hand.
2. I'm looking for ways to kiss you.
3. I'm looking for ways to hug you.
4. I'm looking for ways to put my arm around your waist.

6/14/24, 10:19 - HrishavSaha: Why not you? 😂
6/14/24, 10:19 - HrishavSaha: Though it's pretty obvious to diva now that we've got chemistry
6/14/24, 10:19 - Purvi: Actually
6/14/24, 10:20 - Purvi: She might think that
6/14/24, 10:20 - HrishavSaha: Mmhmm
6/14/24, 10:20 - Purvi: But bohot pehle I considered you my brother right
6/14/24, 10:20 - HrishavSaha: And I like that she's not the type to make a big deal out of it
6/14/24, 10:21 - HrishavSaha: Mmhmm
6/14/24, 10:21 - Purvi: Yeah so that was that
6/14/24, 10:22 - Purvi: So think she has her doubts
6/14/24, 10:22 - HrishavSaha: It's fine. She won't make a big deal if she does get to know
6/14/24, 10:22 - HrishavSaha: What do you think?
6/14/24, 10:22 - Purvi: Ya I dont have any problem telling her

6/14/24, 11:08 - HrishavSaha: Alright, tell me about the loshu grid you made for us
6/14/24, 11:09 - Purvi: So we each get the profit of 2 no. From each other
6/14/24, 11:10 - Purvi: You get no 6 which is money, luxury, and materialistic life and no. 7 which is spirituality and exploring and intuition from me
6/14/24, 11:10 - Purvi: And I get
6/14/24, 11:11 - HrishavSaha: That's cool
6/14/24, 11:11 - Purvi: No. 8 which is discipline, knowledge and no. 5 stability, growth, wisdom and also no. 5 is soft spoken
6/14/24, 11:12 - Purvi: Right
6/14/24, 11:12 - Purvi: And so it leaves only one no. Not their
6/14/24, 11:12 - Purvi: Which is 4
6/14/24, 11:12 - Purvi: Which is not that necessary anyway
6/14/24, 11:12 - HrishavSaha: Yep, you need 5
6/14/24, 11:13 - HrishavSaha: 😂
6/14/24, 11:13 - HrishavSaha: And I could use 7

6/14/24, 11:14 - Purvi: Noo
6/14/24, 11:15 - Purvi: Having it can make you more practical also
6/14/24, 11:15 - Purvi: But meh

6/14/24, 14:04 - HrishavSaha: 😂
6/14/24, 14:04 - HrishavSaha: Atleast he's not an old buddha
6/14/24, 14:04 - Purvi: Oh he is
6/14/24, 14:04 - Purvi: Mentally

6/14/24, 14:09 - Purvi: Net is slow
6/14/24, 14:09 - HrishavSaha: You'd believe you're in heaven
6/14/24, 14:09 - HrishavSaha: Alright
6/14/24, 14:10 - HrishavSaha: And with a coke in one hand, you in my other arm, it'd be simply perfect
6/14/24, 14:11 - HrishavSaha: Say something 💀

6/14/24, 14:15 - HrishavSaha: 💀
6/14/24, 14:15 - Purvi: Obvi they can arrest you for fricking anything for fricking forever
6/14/24, 14:15 - HrishavSaha: People try extreme sports for life and death experiences
6/14/24, 14:15 - HrishavSaha: Purvi goes to north korea
6/14/24, 14:15 - HrishavSaha: 😂
6/14/24, 14:15 - HrishavSaha: So it'll be your life's last experience 💀
6/14/24, 14:16 - Purvi: Maybe
6/14/24, 14:16 - Purvi: And then Italy also
6/14/24, 14:16 - Purvi: Obviously want to try authentic pasta
6/14/24, 14:16 - HrishavSaha: Mmhmm
6/14/24, 14:17 - HrishavSaha: I'd make you Alfredo pasta, but heavy cream is expensive 💀
6/14/24, 14:17 - HrishavSaha: And pretty much useless in regular recipes
6/14/24, 14:17 - Purvi: Ohh and I really want to climb Everest
6/14/24, 14:17 - HrishavSaha: Ah, that's a nice one
6/14/24, 14:17 - HrishavSaha: I wouldn't mind giving it a try either

6/14/24, 14:18 - HrishavSaha: Mmhmm
6/14/24, 14:18 - Purvi: We ll do it together
6/14/24, 14:18 - HrishavSaha: Never thought you'd ask
6/14/24, 14:18 - Purvi: I am not asking 💀😂😂
6/14/24, 14:19 - HrishavSaha: 😂It's a figure of speech
6/14/24, 14:19 - HrishavSaha: Anyway
6/14/24, 14:19 - HrishavSaha: I'm following you everywhere
6/14/24, 14:19 - HrishavSaha: Except NK. I'm good
6/14/24, 14:19 - HrishavSaha: 😂
6/14/24, 14:20 - Purvi: Heyyyy
6/14/24, 14:20 - Purvi: You ll come
6/14/24, 14:20 - HrishavSaha: 😂😂😂
6/14/24, 14:20 - HrishavSaha: You go there at the age of 80
6/14/24, 14:20 - Purvi: K next word?
6/14/24, 14:20 - HrishavSaha: Spend the rest of your life in jail😂💀
6/14/24, 14:20 - Purvi: 💀
6/14/24, 14:21 - Purvi: Un popular opinion
6/14/24, 14:21 - Purvi: But
6/14/24, 14:21 - Purvi: I want to like till max 70
6/14/24, 14:21 - Purvi: I mean you do not live when you are old
6/14/24, 14:22 - Purvi: You just breathe
6/14/24, 14:22 - HrishavSaha: Well, you do have a point there
6/14/24, 14:22 - Purvi: Aur meri family ke amazing genes
6/14/24, 14:22 - HrishavSaha: A lot of people fill out DNR forms
6/14/24, 14:22 - Purvi: I think I am going to get Parkinson and the thing where you forget stuff
6/14/24, 14:23 - Purvi: Definitely
6/14/24, 14:23 - HrishavSaha: Alzheimers
6/14/24, 14:23 - Purvi: Where you find out jaldi?
6/14/24, 14:23 - HrishavSaha: 😂Idk. At a hospital, maybe?
6/14/24, 14:24 - HrishavSaha: They definitely won't hand it out to an underage kid, that's for sure
6/14/24, 14:24 - Purvi: Arrey nhi
6/14/24, 14:24 - Purvi: Where you find out time se pehle what diseases you have
6/14/24, 14:25 - Purvi: Weird way to put it
6/14/24, 14:25 - HrishavSaha: Ah, no no
6/14/24, 14:25 - Purvi: Whatever
6/14/24, 14:25 - HrishavSaha: A DNR form doesn't have anything to do with diseases
6/14/24, 14:25 - HrishavSaha: It's a Do Not Revive form
6/14/24, 14:25 - HrishavSaha: Meaning, let's say you're old and frail
6/14/24, 14:26 - HrishavSaha: And you're just "breathing"
6/14/24, 14:26 - HrishavSaha: If your heart collapses, but simple logic, they'll give you cpr
6/14/24, 14:26 - HrishavSaha: Or something
6/14/24, 14:26 - HrishavSaha: But a DNR basically says, "Don't revive me in case I'm about to die"
6/14/24, 14:26 - HrishavSaha: Probably cause reviving is more painful than dying
6/14/24, 14:26 - Purvi: Ohhh
6/14/24, 14:27 - HrishavSaha: Cpr itself can cause multiple rib fractures
6/14/24, 14:27 - Purvi: Righttt
6/14/24, 14:27 - HrishavSaha: Infact, if bones DON'T break, you DEFINITELY didn't do cpr properly
6/14/24, 14:27 - Purvi: 💀
6/14/24, 14:28 - HrishavSaha: 😂
6/14/24, 14:28 - HrishavSaha: It works on the "broken is better than dead" principle
6/14/24, 14:28 - HrishavSaha: Ribs heal really fast, compared to other bones
6/14/24, 14:29 - Purvi: Good to know I guess 😂😂
6/14/24, 14:29 - HrishavSaha: 😂
6/14/24, 14:29 - HrishavSaha: Okay, next word
6/14/24, 14:29 - HrishavSaha: Ambition
6/14/24, 14:30 - Purvi: Do yk what I would be if it weren't for the money or the success rate?
6/14/24, 14:30 - HrishavSaha: What?
6/14/24, 14:30 - Purvi: Guess
6/14/24, 14:30 - HrishavSaha: Astrologer?
6/14/24, 14:31 - Purvi: Nhi
6/14/24, 14:31 - HrishavSaha: Then?
6/14/24, 14:32 - Purvi: Either a physicic the paranormal ghost investigator wala
6/14/24, 14:32 - Purvi: Or a marine biologist
6/14/24, 14:32 - HrishavSaha: Unique😂
6/14/24, 14:32 - HrishavSaha: That sounds nice
6/14/24, 14:33 - Purvi: All they do is explore the ocean and stuff
6/14/24, 14:33 - Purvi: That si Mera first option
6/14/24, 14:33 - HrishavSaha: They're basically archaeologists of the ocean
6/14/24, 14:33 - HrishavSaha: Well
6/14/24, 14:33 - HrishavSaha: Whatever you wanna be
6/14/24, 14:33 - HrishavSaha: I'll be here to support you
6/14/24, 14:34 - Purvi: Well I guess I ll be a CA
6/14/24, 14:34 - HrishavSaha: Just do what you know you'll love
6/14/24, 14:34 - Purvi: And after retirement I ll become a investigator
6/14/24, 14:35 - HrishavSaha: Doesn't sound half bad
6/14/24, 14:35 - Purvi: CA is not bad
6/14/24, 14:35 - Purvi: Righttt
6/14/24, 14:35 - Purvi: What abt you
6/14/24, 14:35 - Purvi: If it weren't for the money
6/14/24, 14:35 - HrishavSaha: Salary wise, it's awesome. But what matters is what you want
6/14/24, 14:36 - HrishavSaha: I'd still be a software engineer, even if it weren't for the money
6/14/24, 14:36 - Purvi: Boringgggg
6/14/24, 14:36 - HrishavSaha: 😂
6/14/24, 14:36 - Purvi: Brb
6/14/24, 14:36 - HrishavSaha: Sure
6/14/24, 14:39 - Purvi: As I was saying
6/14/24, 14:39 - Purvi: It would be kinda impractical if I became a paranormal investigator
6/14/24, 14:39 - Purvi: Definitely
6/14/24, 14:39 - HrishavSaha: Why so?
6/14/24, 14:40 - Purvi: It just will be
6/14/24, 14:41 - Purvi: It's the success rate
6/14/24, 14:41 - Purvi: What if I am not able to earn money from it
6/14/24, 14:41 - HrishavSaha: You don't really need money from a retirement job
6/14/24, 14:41 - HrishavSaha: It's more of a hobby
6/14/24, 14:42 - Purvi: Haa
6/14/24, 14:42 - Purvi: I thought
6/14/24, 14:42 - Purvi: Ki directly become an investigator
6/14/24, 14:43 - HrishavSaha: Mmhmm
6/14/24, 14:43 - HrishavSaha: Well

6/14/24, 14:44 - Purvi: Do you have word?
6/14/24, 14:44 - Purvi: Can't think of anything
6/14/24, 14:45 - HrishavSaha: Well
6/14/24, 14:45 - HrishavSaha: "Purvi"
6/14/24, 14:45 - Purvi: The word is Purvi?
6/14/24, 14:45 - HrishavSaha: Yeah
6/14/24, 14:46 - Purvi: There are so many things yet nothing
6/14/24, 14:46 - Purvi: What can I tell you abt me
6/14/24, 14:46 - HrishavSaha: Whatever
6/14/24, 14:47 - HrishavSaha: I could listen to anything you'd say
6/14/24, 14:47 - Purvi: Yarr be more specific na
6/14/24, 14:47 - HrishavSaha: Idk
6/14/24, 14:48 - HrishavSaha: Anything that comes to your mind
6/14/24, 14:48 - Purvi: What if I tell you the word is hrishav
6/14/24, 14:48 - Purvi: Say
6/14/24, 14:48 - HrishavSaha: Well
6/14/24, 14:48 - HrishavSaha: I have a thing for video games
6/14/24, 14:49 - HrishavSaha: But you already know that
6/14/24, 14:49 - HrishavSaha: Then I have a thing for you
6/14/24, 14:49 - HrishavSaha: But you also know that
6/14/24, 14:49 - HrishavSaha: If the word's "Hrishav", the word that completes it is "Tanishka"
6/14/24, 14:50 - HrishavSaha: There you have it
6/14/24, 14:50 - Purvi: Ohk
6/14/24, 14:50 - Purvi: I mean what do you think abt yourself
6/14/24, 14:51 - HrishavSaha: Ah...
6/14/24, 14:51 - Purvi: What kind of a person do you think you are
6/14/24, 14:51 - HrishavSaha: I believe I'm a serious person, with an objective perspective of the world
6/14/24, 14:51 - HrishavSaha: Someone who usually looks at logic and reasoning
6/14/24, 14:52 - HrishavSaha: I don't like abstract concepts which lack a proper definition, since everyone interprets it differently
6/14/24, 14:52 - HrishavSaha: And that lays the basis for misunderstanding
6/14/24, 14:52 - HrishavSaha: I'm also a socially awkward and relatively emotionless person, I believe
6/14/24, 14:53 - HrishavSaha: Yeah, that's about it
6/14/24, 14:53 - Purvi: You are not emotional less stop believing that😂😂💀
6/14/24, 14:53 - Purvi: You have just turned off your emotions
6/14/24, 14:54 - Purvi: And then something will trigger the. And it will all come out once💀
6/14/24, 14:54 - Purvi: Happens
6/14/24, 14:54 - HrishavSaha: And what's that something? Any idea, ma'am?
6/14/24, 14:54 - Purvi: Anything
6/14/24, 14:55 - Purvi: Like literally the smallest thing
6/14/24, 14:55 - Purvi: That is most probably nostalgic
6/14/24, 14:55 - HrishavSaha: Don't have a ton of nostalgic moments, yknow😂
6/14/24, 14:56 - Purvi: K that's what I believe and that's what happens to me
6/14/24, 14:56 - HrishavSaha: Either way
6/14/24, 14:56 - HrishavSaha: You're here for me
6/14/24, 14:56 - HrishavSaha: I'm sure I'll get through any difficulty
6/14/24, 14:56 - Purvi: When did you last cry?
6/14/24, 14:57 - Purvi: Brb
6/14/24, 14:57 - HrishavSaha: Funny, that. I don't remember, actually. It's been years, purvi
6/14/24, 14:57 - HrishavSaha: Sure
6/14/24, 15:01 - Purvi: But
6/14/24, 15:02 - Purvi: Wait ok
6/14/24, 15:02 - HrishavSaha: Okay
6/14/24, 15:02 - Purvi: Thats something
6/14/24, 15:02 - HrishavSaha: Well
6/14/24, 15:03 - HrishavSaha: It's not like I haven't felt that I wanna cry
6/14/24, 15:03 - HrishavSaha: It's just that I physically can't
6/14/24, 15:03 - Purvi: Ha that Ik
6/14/24, 15:03 - Purvi: Ok I guess
6/14/24, 15:04 - Purvi: So is that what makes you think you are emotion less
6/14/24, 15:04 - HrishavSaha: I guess
6/14/24, 15:04 - HrishavSaha: And that I'm not good at expressing what I feel
6/14/24, 15:05 - Purvi: You cannot be emotionless just bc you don't cry I mean😂😂
6/14/24, 15:05 - Purvi: Actually idk abt that too
6/14/24, 15:06 - Purvi: Rightt
6/14/24, 15:06 - HrishavSaha: Idk
6/14/24, 15:06 - HrishavSaha: I'm just trying to make do with what life gives me
6/14/24, 15:06 - Purvi: Crying is not an emotion
6/14/24, 15:06 - Purvi: It's sadness or happiness
6/14/24, 15:07 - HrishavSaha: You're probably the only thing in a long while that I took from life, forcefully. Because I wanted you
6/14/24, 15:09 - Purvi: K next word?
6/14/24, 15:09 - Purvi: This made sense right
6/14/24, 15:09 - HrishavSaha: Idk, really. Like I told you. I have trouble with abstract concepts. Emotions is one of em
6/14/24, 15:10 - Purvi: It's funny
6/14/24, 15:10 - Purvi: How you can't get that
6/14/24, 15:10 - HrishavSaha: Idk
6/14/24, 15:11 - Purvi: Ohk
6/14/24, 15:11 - Purvi: ...
6/14/24, 15:11 - HrishavSaha: It's still "Purvi"
6/14/24, 15:12 - Purvi: I think I am a pretty unserious person
6/14/24, 15:12 - HrishavSaha: Used to be
6/14/24, 15:12 - Purvi: And I also kind of weird
6/14/24, 15:12 - HrishavSaha: Not as much, anymore
6/14/24, 15:12 - Purvi: Really
6/14/24, 15:12 - HrishavSaha: Yeah
6/14/24, 15:13 - Purvi: And I guess I can say that I am also unique 😎✨✨🤌🏻
6/14/24, 15:13 - HrishavSaha: You've got a mix of unseriousness and seriousness. That's how it should be
6/14/24, 15:13 - HrishavSaha: 😂I won't comment. From my perspective, you've the only one on earth
6/14/24, 15:13 - Purvi: Many ppl tell me that I have a big personality
6/14/24, 15:14 - Purvi: 💀✨✨
6/14/24, 15:14 - HrishavSaha: Big personality?
6/14/24, 15:14 - Purvi: Ha
6/14/24, 15:14 - HrishavSaha: I mean, what do you mean by that
6/14/24, 15:14 - Purvi: Do you think
6/14/24, 15:15 - Purvi: Idk
6/14/24, 15:15 - Purvi: Like big personality matalab
6/14/24, 15:15 - Purvi: Search for the exact meaning
6/14/24, 15:16 - Purvi: Can't explain it
6/14/24, 15:16 - HrishavSaha: Idk about it, then
6/14/24, 15:16 - HrishavSaha: If you mean being social and friendly, then yes
6/14/24, 15:17 - Purvi: That is somewhat
6/14/24, 15:18 - Purvi: And I have a lot of things going on
6/14/24, 15:18 - Purvi: Like many traits
6/14/24, 15:18 - HrishavSaha: You can tell me about em, if you want
6/14/24, 15:19 - Purvi: Not things
6/14/24, 15:19 - Purvi: Traits
6/14/24, 15:19 - HrishavSaha: Yeah, I don't mind you tell me what they are
6/14/24, 15:20 - Purvi: Idk what they are😂😂💀
6/14/24, 15:20 - HrishavSaha: 😂😂😂
6/14/24, 15:21 - Purvi: And I can say I know a lie or a truth when I hear one
6/14/24, 15:21 - HrishavSaha: That's an useful ability
6/14/24, 15:22 - Purvi: I like to judge 💀

6/14/24, 15:23 - Purvi: Nhi I don't have you
6/14/24, 15:23 - HrishavSaha: The grammar.... 💀

6/14/24, 15:24 - HrishavSaha: Never needed to
6/14/24, 15:25 - HrishavSaha: Plus, it's easier to win a person over with the truth than with a lie
6/14/24, 15:25 - Purvi: ✨✨
6/14/24, 15:26 - Purvi: I had a tendency to lie abt stuff when I was choti
6/14/24, 15:26 - Purvi: A lot

6/14/24, 19:16 - HrishavSaha: Btw
6/14/24, 19:16 - HrishavSaha: She had NO clue you were hiding something from her
6/14/24, 19:16 - Purvi: You asked her?
6/14/24, 19:17 - HrishavSaha: 😂Yeah
6/14/24, 19:17 - Purvi: Why did you
6/14/24, 19:17 - HrishavSaha: Should I not have?
6/14/24, 19:17 - Purvi: Now she ll feel bad until I come back and tell her
6/14/24, 19:17 - HrishavSaha: Nah
6/14/24, 19:18 - HrishavSaha: I framed it properly
6/14/24, 19:18 - Purvi: Really what did you say
6/14/24, 19:18 - HrishavSaha: "she's got a good news for you once she's back"
6/14/24, 19:18 - HrishavSaha: With a thumbs uo
6/14/24, 19:18 - HrishavSaha: Up
6/14/24, 19:18 - HrishavSaha: 😂
6/14/24, 19:18 - Purvi: Ohk
6/14/24, 19:18 - Purvi: 👍😂😂
6/14/24, 19:18 - HrishavSaha: Handled that properly, I guess?
6/14/24, 19:19 - Purvi: Yupp
6/14/24, 19:19 - HrishavSaha: Oh, btw
6/14/24, 19:19 - HrishavSaha: You said you messed up our loshu grid earlier?
6/14/24, 19:20 - Purvi: Oh haa
6/14/24, 19:20 - HrishavSaha: Lemme know when you redo it
6/14/24, 19:20 - Purvi: We have to do the remedy for no. 3 too
6/14/24, 19:20 - HrishavSaha: Which is?
6/14/24, 19:20 - Purvi: We have 3 and 4 missing
6/14/24, 19:21 - Purvi: Jupiter which gives wisdom and knowledge
6/14/24, 19:21 - HrishavSaha: I meant the remedy
6/14/24, 19:21 - Purvi: Plants
6/14/24, 19:21 - HrishavSaha: Why are half the remedies related to caring for plants 💀
6/14/24, 19:22 - Purvi: Wooden keychains and pens and stuff should be with all the time
6/14/24, 19:22 - Purvi: Ikr
6/14/24, 19:22 - Purvi: 😂😂
6/14/24, 19:22 - HrishavSaha: Where do I get an wooden pen from, now
6/14/24, 19:22 - Purvi: Anything wooden
6/14/24, 19:22 - Purvi: Or just plants are also fine
6/14/24, 19:22 - Purvi: Whatever
6/14/24, 19:22 - HrishavSaha: Alright, I'll figure something out
6/14/24, 19:23 - HrishavSaha: I do have a Keychain but it's probably engineer wood, not real wood
6/14/24, 19:23 - Purvi: ...
6/14/24, 19:23 - HrishavSaha: I get it
6/14/24, 19:23 - HrishavSaha: But I'll just keep something wooden with me too
6/14/24, 19:24 - HrishavSaha: Dunno if it works, but on the chance it does, doesn't hurt to go all out, huh?
6/14/24, 19:24 - Purvi: Oh that keychain you got from vrindavan
6/14/24, 19:24 - Purvi: That counts right
6/14/24, 19:24 - HrishavSaha: And like I said, anything is worth it if it's for you
6/14/24, 19:24 - HrishavSaha: Ah right
6/14/24, 19:24 - HrishavSaha: Yep
6/14/24, 19:25 - HrishavSaha: Gonna be honest, T
6/14/24, 19:25 - HrishavSaha: For a while, I felt that it was just me who's enthusiastic about the relationship and you were simply humoring me
6/14/24, 19:25 - HrishavSaha: Well, I couldn't be more wrong
6/14/24, 19:26 - Purvi: Hooooo
6/14/24, 19:26 - Purvi: How could you think that
6/14/24, 19:26 - HrishavSaha: Yup, my bad
6/14/24, 19:26 - Purvi: Bruhh💀😂😂
6/14/24, 19:27 - HrishavSaha: In your own way, you love and care for me
6/14/24, 19:27 - HrishavSaha: And I might not show it, but I appreciate it a lot
6/14/24, 19:28 - Purvi: Ohk✨✨😎
6/14/24, 19:28 - HrishavSaha: 😂You need emoji training
6/14/24, 19:30 - Purvi: Whyyy
6/14/24, 19:30 - Purvi: I think the emojis I use are very appropriate
6/14/24, 19:30 - HrishavSaha: The 😎???!!
6/14/24, 19:31 - HrishavSaha: That was appropriate in that scenario?! 💀
6/14/24, 19:33 - Purvi: Yeahh
6/14/24, 19:33 - HrishavSaha: 😂😂
6/14/24, 19:33 - HrishavSaha: Cutie
6/14/24, 19:34 - Purvi: 💀✨
6/14/24, 19:34 - HrishavSaha: ♥️
6/14/24, 19:36 - Purvi: Do you have dusre students ka tution aaj
6/14/24, 19:36 - Purvi: Shitttttt
6/14/24, 19:36 - HrishavSaha: No
6/14/24, 19:36 - HrishavSaha: What?
6/14/24, 19:36 - Purvi: Abhi tak jo bhi maths mein ch padhe he
6/14/24, 19:36 - Purvi: Unka test hoga ab👍
6/14/24, 19:37 - HrishavSaha: 😂😂😂
6/14/24, 19:37 - Purvi: 🤦🏻‍♀️💀
6/14/24, 19:37 - HrishavSaha: Awesome
6/14/24, 19:37 - HrishavSaha: Best of luck
6/14/24, 19:37 - Purvi: Why are you enjoying this
6/14/24, 19:38 - HrishavSaha: You're gonna do great
6/14/24, 19:38 - HrishavSaha: I trust you
6/14/24, 19:40 - Purvi: 🤦🏻‍♀️
6/14/24, 19:40 - Purvi: But yk what
6/14/24, 19:41 - Purvi: I take it back you are not that cruel😂😂💀
6/14/24, 19:41 - HrishavSaha: Woah
6/14/24, 19:42 - HrishavSaha: That's some improvement
6/14/24, 19:43 - Purvi: 💀
6/14/24, 20:14 - Purvi: Heyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy
6/14/24, 20:20 - HrishavSaha: Hey, babe
6/14/24, 20:23 - Purvi: Whatcha doinggggggg
6/14/24, 20:23 - HrishavSaha: Thinking bout us
6/14/24, 20:24 - Purvi: Reallyyy?
6/14/24, 20:24 - Purvi: Ohk
6/14/24, 20:24 - HrishavSaha: Yep
6/14/24, 20:25 - Purvi: Well What are you thinking
6/14/24, 20:25 - HrishavSaha: Well
6/14/24, 20:25 - HrishavSaha: How good the two of us look when we're holding hands and walking
6/14/24, 20:25 - HrishavSaha: If only there was someone clicking a Pic of us from behind
6/14/24, 20:26 - Purvi: Yarr we don't even have photo togather
6/14/24, 20:31 - HrishavSaha: Yeah
6/14/24, 20:31 - HrishavSaha: It's fine
6/14/24, 20:31 - HrishavSaha: We'll take lots
6/14/24, 20:32 - HrishavSaha: Plus, there's a saying. "the best moments are always left unphotographed"
6/14/24, 20:32 - Purvi: True
6/14/24, 20:32 - Purvi: But think abt it
6/14/24, 20:33 - Purvi: Mere fyp par aya tha
6/14/24, 20:33 - Purvi: How much would you pay to see the best moments of your life as a film
6/14/24, 20:33 - HrishavSaha: Haha
6/14/24, 20:33 - HrishavSaha: Such things can't really be bought, can it?
6/14/24, 20:34 - HrishavSaha: They're priceless
6/14/24, 20:34 - Purvi: True
6/14/24, 20:34 - Purvi: I really hope someone can create a chip or smth
6/14/24, 20:34 - Purvi: Jisme memories and dreams record ho
6/14/24, 20:34 - HrishavSaha: Well, it's not entirely impossible
6/14/24, 20:35 - Purvi: Ha actually
6/14/24, 20:35 - HrishavSaha: Technically speaking
6/14/24, 20:35 - HrishavSaha: Memories are stored somewhere in the brain
6/14/24, 20:35 - HrishavSaha: And they have a signature emotion attached to them
6/14/24, 20:35 - HrishavSaha: Like, happy memories are happy cuz they encourage the secretion of dopamine
6/14/24, 20:36 - HrishavSaha: So if we could just locate and extract these memories, segregate them based on this signature emotion, and boom, you've got a person's entire life as a movie
6/14/24, 20:36 - Purvi: But
6/14/24, 20:37 - Purvi: They are not real
6/14/24, 20:37 - Purvi: Or like hardcopy😂😂💀
6/14/24, 20:37 - HrishavSaha: 😂
6/14/24, 20:37 - HrishavSaha: Well, you're not fabricating anything with AI, so from originality of data, it's 100% real
6/14/24, 20:38 - HrishavSaha: But things get muddy when matters like ethics and morality comes into play
6/14/24, 20:38 - HrishavSaha: Having access to a person's complete memories is dangerous. Invasion of privacy and stuff
6/14/24, 20:38 - HrishavSaha: 💀
6/14/24, 20:38 - HrishavSaha: I'm blabbering
6/14/24, 20:39 - Purvi: Noo
6/14/24, 20:39 - Purvi: But it's whatever
6/14/24, 20:39 - Purvi: And the crime stuff would be easy to judge
6/14/24, 20:39 - Purvi: We can just have ai do it
6/14/24, 20:39 - HrishavSaha: Yeah
6/14/24, 20:40 - Purvi: Take out the chip and just see the memory
6/14/24, 20:40 - HrishavSaha: That ALSO opens up more opportunities to upset the entire system though😂
6/14/24, 20:40 - HrishavSaha: If memories are all stored on a chip, people will eventually try to fabricate memories in pursuit of happiness
6/14/24, 20:40 - Purvi: Ohhh and it would be so cool if we can just delete a memory
6/14/24, 20:41 - Purvi: True
6/14/24, 20:41 - HrishavSaha: It's a complicated process😂
6/14/24, 20:41 - HrishavSaha: And a lot of people have thought about it before
6/14/24, 20:42 - HrishavSaha: The current game I'm playing, Cyberpunk 2077, is based on the very concept that humans can be augmented in almost any way possible with cyborg implants and slot in chips called shards
6/14/24, 20:42 - Purvi: Ohhhk
6/14/24, 20:43 - HrishavSaha: For now
6/14/24, 20:43 - HrishavSaha: Let's focus on creating memories, holding onto them, and thinking back on them, organically
6/14/24, 20:43 - Purvi: Boringgg😂😂💀
6/14/24, 20:44 - Purvi: But atleast dream recorder hona chahiye
6/14/24, 20:44 - Purvi: Atleast
6/14/24, 20:44 - HrishavSaha: 😂The memory chip is a much more feasible idea
6/14/24, 20:45 - HrishavSaha: Dreams, and the way they occur, simply break the current understanding of science we have
6/14/24, 20:45 - Purvi: Really
6/14/24, 20:45 - Purvi: Dreams are not explained in science?
6/14/24, 20:48 - HrishavSaha: Nope
6/14/24, 20:48 - HrishavSaha: We just know the sleep cycle
6/14/24, 20:49 - HrishavSaha: We have light sleep, then deeper sleep, then the deepest, also called REM sleep
6/14/24, 20:49 - HrishavSaha: And we dream in REM sleep
6/14/24, 20:50 - HrishavSaha: When, in reality, we've noticed that the brain has so little activity in REM sleep, we can just declare the person brain dead
6/14/24, 20:50 - HrishavSaha: Yes. Sleep is essentially Temporary Death
6/14/24, 20:50 - Purvi: Oh
6/14/24, 20:50 - Purvi: What if we don't dream brain se😂😂
6/14/24, 20:51 - HrishavSaha: We roughly go through two sleep cycles in 8 hours of sleep
6/14/24, 20:51 - HrishavSaha: That means we temporarily die twice each night
6/14/24, 20:51 - HrishavSaha: 💀
6/14/24, 20:51 - Purvi: Stop
6/14/24, 20:51 - Purvi: K stop
6/14/24, 20:52 - HrishavSaha: That would be a wild theory. No other organ has the computational capability to conjure up a dream
6/14/24, 20:52 - HrishavSaha: 😂😂
6/14/24, 20:52 - HrishavSaha: And we DO know that dreams are based off of memories. So it's GOT to do something with the brain
6/14/24, 20:53 - Purvi: Hmmm
6/14/24, 20:55 - HrishavSaha: You really like to talk technical and nerdy with me? 😂
6/14/24, 20:57 - Purvi: Ha💀😂😂
6/14/24, 20:59 - HrishavSaha: ♥️
6/14/24, 20:59 - HrishavSaha: I'll have my dinner and be back
6/14/24, 20:59 - Purvi: K
6/14/24, 21:24 - HrishavSaha: I'm back
6/14/24, 21:24 - HrishavSaha: Took too long. Sorry
6/14/24, 21:42 - HrishavSaha: Lemme know when you're online
6/14/24, 21:58 - Purvi: Heyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy
6/14/24, 21:58 - HrishavSaha: Missed ya
6/14/24, 22:00 - Purvi: Mee too
6/14/24, 22:00 - HrishavSaha: Hey, babe
6/14/24, 22:00 - HrishavSaha: So, um
6/14/24, 22:00 - HrishavSaha: I got a bit of a bad news
6/14/24, 22:00 - Purvi: What now
6/14/24, 22:00 - HrishavSaha: We're going to Dehradun
6/14/24, 22:01 - HrishavSaha: And we'll be back by Wednesday or so
6/14/24, 22:01 - HrishavSaha: I strongly suggested against it
6/14/24, 22:01 - HrishavSaha: But well, who listens
6/14/24, 22:02 - Purvi: I ll be back by Tuesday anyway so it's fine I guess
6/14/24, 22:02 - Purvi: Have fun
6/14/24, 22:02 - Purvi: Wednesday this week right
6/14/24, 22:02 - HrishavSaha: Yeah
6/14/24, 22:02 - HrishavSaha: It's not just about being with you though
6/14/24, 22:02 - HrishavSaha: I'm just not a fan of long trips
6/14/24, 22:03 - HrishavSaha: 🥲
6/14/24, 22:03 - Purvi: Ohk
6/14/24, 22:03 - Purvi: Why though
6/14/24, 22:03 - Purvi: It ll fun na
6/14/24, 22:03 - HrishavSaha: I don't know, exactly
6/14/24, 22:03 - HrishavSaha: I prefer the comfort of my home
6/14/24, 22:03 - Purvi: Kisi reletive ke ghar jaoge kya?
6/14/24, 22:04 - HrishavSaha: Nah. Just sightseeing
6/14/24, 22:04 - Purvi: Nice na
6/14/24, 22:04 - HrishavSaha: Not to mention a total of 20 Hours of travelling
6/14/24, 22:04 - Purvi: Yeah that's long💀
6/14/24, 22:05 - HrishavSaha: Yeah
6/14/24, 22:05 - Purvi: Be optimistic
6/14/24, 22:05 - HrishavSaha: About travelling for 20 hours? 💀
6/14/24, 22:05 - Purvi: K try to be optimistic?😂😂
6/14/24, 22:06 - HrishavSaha: 😂
6/14/24, 22:06 - HrishavSaha: The only thing I like at this current moment is being with you
6/14/24, 22:06 - HrishavSaha: And I mean it
6/14/24, 22:07 - Purvi: But
6/14/24, 22:07 - Purvi: It's not bad news
6/14/24, 22:07 - Purvi: I thought you are on house arrest again
6/14/24, 22:07 - HrishavSaha: Nah nah
6/14/24, 22:07 - Purvi: That would be bad news😂😂💀
6/14/24, 22:07 - HrishavSaha: 💀
6/14/24, 22:08 - HrishavSaha: I'm just experiencing TDS
6/14/24, 22:11 - HrishavSaha: Helloooo?
6/14/24, 22:12 - Purvi: Wait talking to mumma
6/14/24, 22:12 - HrishavSaha: Alright

6/14/24, 22:13 - Purvi: I am experiencing HDS for that matter 😂😂
6/14/24, 22:14 - HrishavSaha: 😂😂

6/14/24, 22:22 - Purvi: You can though
6/14/24, 22:22 - HrishavSaha: It's not that much different from my usual day
6/14/24, 22:23 - HrishavSaha: Swimming with my sweetheart
6/14/24, 22:23 - HrishavSaha: Then a tuition
6/14/24, 22:23 - HrishavSaha: Then spending some more time with my cutie
6/14/24, 22:23 - HrishavSaha: And basically room-bound since then
6/14/24, 22:24 - HrishavSaha: Went outside to play cricket with Tilak for a little bit

6/16/24, 15:08 - Purvi: Huh?
6/16/24, 15:09 - HrishavSaha: That I feel a whole lot more for you than you can start to guess
6/16/24, 15:09 - HrishavSaha: I know. Romance is not your cup of tea
6/16/24, 15:10 - HrishavSaha: And I'm perfectly fine with you just listening to the things I wanna tell ya
6/16/24, 15:10 - HrishavSaha: With you laughing and cringing at almost every sentence
6/16/24, 15:11 - HrishavSaha: As I lose a bit of confidence with each laugh, and when you notice that, you laugh harder
6/16/24, 15:11 - HrishavSaha: The laughing part isn't something I appreciate all the time😂, but I guess it's fine
6/16/24, 15:12 - HrishavSaha: If I wanted to date a regular girl, I would've done that
6/16/24, 15:12 - HrishavSaha: Instead I wanted you
6/16/24, 15:12 - HrishavSaha: Cuz I fell for what you have
6/16/24, 15:13 - HrishavSaha: Your smile, that canine tooth, trashy fashion sense, love for food, amongst other stuff
6/16/24, 15:13 - Purvi: Trashy?!??
6/16/24, 15:13 - Purvi: Heyyy
6/16/24, 15:14 - HrishavSaha: And the reason I basically keep repeating "youre cute" and "love ya" is, deep down, even if I know that you do love me, I want you to love me more
6/16/24, 15:14 - HrishavSaha: 😂We both know it's true
6/16/24, 15:15 - Purvi: Nooo you can just say that I look good in everything I wear😎

6/16/24, 15:15 - Purvi: Heyyy
6/16/24, 15:16 - HrishavSaha: As of now, the only thing you actually look good in, is your swimsuit
6/16/24, 15:16 - HrishavSaha: And well, I'm pretty sure you'd look good without anything on as well * wink wink *

6/16/24, 22:24 - Purvi: Me too
6/16/24, 22:24 - HrishavSaha: We've been surviving here in the desert on soda💀
6/16/24, 22:24 - Purvi: But the faire was not that big exactly
6/16/24, 22:24 - Purvi: 😂😂
6/16/24, 22:24 - HrishavSaha: Then it's fine, I guess
6/16/24, 22:24 - HrishavSaha: The only simple ride I might like is the ferris wheel
6/16/24, 22:24 - HrishavSaha: With ya, ofc
6/16/24, 22:25 - HrishavSaha: Kissing ya at the top would be filmy and cliché, but romantic none the less
6/16/24, 22:25 - HrishavSaha: What?
6/16/24, 22:25 - HrishavSaha: 😂
6/16/24, 22:26 - Purvi: Yk what😂😂
6/16/24, 22:26 - Purvi: You are delulu
6/16/24, 22:26 - HrishavSaha: I am 😂
6/16/24, 22:27 - HrishavSaha: But it's just my way of expressing my love
6/16/24, 22:27 - HrishavSaha: And I'm sure you like and appreciate the gesture, though you won't verbally accept that
6/16/24, 22:28 - Purvi: Yarr you should come to bhilwara with me
6/16/24, 22:28 - Purvi: Next time
6/16/24, 22:28 - HrishavSaha: You say it as if I don't wanna be with ya
6/16/24, 22:28 - Purvi: For the soda, gola, panipuri etc etc
6/16/24, 22:28 - HrishavSaha: And you?
6/16/24, 22:28 - Purvi: And me 😂
6/16/24, 22:29 - HrishavSaha: That's more like it
6/16/24, 22:29 - HrishavSaha: Um
6/16/24, 22:29 - HrishavSaha: This might be out of the blue
6/16/24, 22:29 - HrishavSaha: But
6/16/24, 22:30 - HrishavSaha: I'm sorry in advance
6/16/24, 22:30 - HrishavSaha: If I ever sound insecure
6/16/24, 22:30 - Purvi: Insecure?
6/16/24, 22:30 - Purvi: Of what
6/16/24, 22:31 - HrishavSaha: Insecure that the other person doesn't truly love me. That she's pretending for my sake
6/16/24, 22:31 - HrishavSaha: Happened with me before. A lot of times
6/16/24, 22:32 - HrishavSaha: So... Sorry in advance for that
6/16/24, 22:32 - HrishavSaha: I know you love me a lot
6/16/24, 22:32 - HrishavSaha: But if I ever behave like an idiot
6/16/24, 22:32 - Purvi: If you ever do feel that way tell mee
6/16/24, 22:32 - HrishavSaha: Please just ne patient with me
6/16/24, 22:32 - HrishavSaha: Be*

6/16/24, 22:33 - HrishavSaha: For not laughing at my face. I know it's a stupid thing
6/16/24, 22:34 - HrishavSaha: Part of the reason why I keep repeating that I love you and that you're cute
6/16/24, 22:34 - Purvi: And yeah that was out of the blue😂😂
6/16/24, 22:35 - HrishavSaha: Is that I'm reaffirming my love for you. And sorta hoping for a return "I love you too" or "aww thanks♥️"
6/16/24, 22:35 - HrishavSaha: Ikr?
6/16/24, 22:36 - Purvi: Ohk
6/16/24, 22:36 - Purvi: I gotta charge my phone

6/16/24, 22:48 - HrishavSaha: Hii
6/16/24, 22:49 - HrishavSaha: Sorry if I ruined the mood back there
6/16/24, 22:49 - Purvi: Nah it's finee
6/16/24, 22:49 - HrishavSaha: You do have challenging road ahead😂
6/16/24, 22:50 - HrishavSaha: An emotionally unstable, hopeless and delusional romantic, genius(maybe?) who's also a shut-in, on your first relationship
6/16/24, 22:51 - Purvi: Genius😂😂😂
6/16/24, 22:51 - Purvi: Funny
6/16/24, 22:51 - Purvi: Haha
6/16/24, 22:51 - HrishavSaha: Yeah, you had to latch onto that word, didn't ya? 😂
6/16/24, 22:51 - HrishavSaha: I do know that I'm much better than the average person
6/16/24, 22:51 - HrishavSaha: But that's it
6/16/24, 22:52 - Purvi: Yupp

6/16/24, 22:52 - HrishavSaha: Yep
6/16/24, 22:52 - HrishavSaha: The only thing I can guarantee you is that I'll love you till my dying breath
6/16/24, 22:53 - HrishavSaha: And maybe a bit of my pessimistic and fatalist philosophy
6/16/24, 22:55 - HrishavSaha: Say something 😂
6/16/24, 22:56 - Purvi: 😂💀
6/16/24, 22:56 - Purvi: Ohk niceeee

6/16/24, 22:56 - HrishavSaha: You saying anything good to me sounds like an achievement 💀
6/16/24, 22:57 - Purvi: 😂😂
6/16/24, 22:57 - Purvi: What if I say
6/16/24, 22:57 - Purvi: I meant it sarcasticly
6/16/24, 22:57 - Purvi: The nicee
6/16/24, 22:57 - HrishavSaha: That'd be in line with your "big" personality

6/16/24, 23:05 - HrishavSaha: It's among the few tasks I enjoy
6/16/24, 23:05 - HrishavSaha: And definitely one of three tasks I LOVE
6/16/24, 23:06 - Purvi: And What are those 3 tasks
6/16/24, 23:06 - HrishavSaha: 1. Being with ya
2. Studying

6/16/24, 23:08 - HrishavSaha: We've known each other for barely 5 months
6/16/24, 23:08 - HrishavSaha: And lovers or not, I believe it's safe to say that we've formed an inseparable bond
6/16/24, 23:09 - Purvi: True
6/16/24, 23:09 - HrishavSaha: We've definitely loved each other from a long while back without noticing
6/16/24, 23:09 - Purvi: Ikr
6/16/24, 23:10 - Purvi: Soo weird
6/16/24, 23:10 - HrishavSaha: Ikr
6/16/24, 23:10 - HrishavSaha: And weird as it is, 80% of the credit goes to that broken leg incident
6/16/24, 23:10 - Purvi: Whyy
6/16/24, 23:11 - HrishavSaha: I'm sure that's when we grew the closest
6/16/24, 23:11 - Purvi: It was after
6/16/24, 23:11 - HrishavSaha: My day routine sorta became intertwined with the fact that I had to check up on you
6/16/24, 23:11 - HrishavSaha: Well, ofc. It was after as well
6/16/24, 23:12 - HrishavSaha: It was before too
6/16/24, 23:12 - HrishavSaha: When I thought you were a studious girl💀
6/16/24, 23:12 - HrishavSaha: And shy
6/16/24, 23:12 - HrishavSaha: That shy imagination of you lives rent free in my head though
6/16/24, 23:13 - Purvi: 😂😂
6/16/24, 23:13 - Purvi: Why
6/16/24, 23:13 - HrishavSaha: She's way cuter than the real brat

6/16/24, 23:18 - Purvi: But what do I admit when there is nothing to admit 😂
6/16/24, 23:18 - Purvi: 😂😂😂
6/16/24, 23:18 - HrishavSaha: See! You'll never admit shit🥲
6/16/24, 23:19 - Purvi: Again
6/16/24, 23:19 - Purvi: ...
6/16/24, 23:19 - HrishavSaha: That's your way of "na rhegi baas, na bajegi bansuri"
6/16/24, 23:20 - Purvi: What's with the muhavras😂😂
6/16/24, 23:20 - HrishavSaha: They're reality
6/16/24, 23:20 - Purvi: Ohk
6/16/24, 23:20 - HrishavSaha: "muh pe ram, bagal mein churi"
6/16/24, 23:21 - Purvi: I don't know iska matlab
6/16/24, 23:21 - HrishavSaha: It basically means "saying something, doing something else, usually the opposite"
6/16/24, 23:22 - Purvi: So how is that releted
6/16/24, 23:22 - HrishavSaha: Yeah
6/16/24, 23:22 - HrishavSaha: You say you love me
6/16/24, 23:22 - HrishavSaha: And then you hit me with sarcasm and existential crisis
6/16/24, 23:23 - HrishavSaha: It's almost like, "you're the cause of my depression, and the remedy to it"
6/16/24, 23:23 - HrishavSaha: 💀
6/16/24, 23:23 - Purvi: Kinda like that

6/20/24, 21:45 - HrishavSaha: Idk, just wanted to put it out there
6/20/24, 21:45 - HrishavSaha: That our teacher-student relationship shouldn't affect our relation. And vice versa
6/20/24, 21:46 - HrishavSaha: I know it won't. I know you understand that. But I just wanted to say it
6/20/24, 21:46 - Purvi: Just dont say things that change my motivation to proving you wrong😂😂

6/20/24, 21:48 - HrishavSaha: Especially for a couple that loves brownies

6/20/24, 21:51 - HrishavSaha: 😂
6/20/24, 21:52 - HrishavSaha: But I know what it means to you, being in a relationship
6/20/24, 21:52 - HrishavSaha: It's your first

6/21/24, 21:16 - HrishavSaha: Either way
6/21/24, 21:17 - HrishavSaha: About telling her
6/21/24, 21:17 - HrishavSaha: I'm not against it
6/21/24, 21:17 - HrishavSaha: But she'll be a liability
6/21/24, 21:17 - Purvi: But not pari
6/21/24, 21:17 - HrishavSaha: Such things don't stay secrets
6/21/24, 21:17 - Purvi: Umm I mean
6/21/24, 21:17 - HrishavSaha: You can't expect it to not leak to Pari if you do tell mishthi
6/21/24, 21:17 - Purvi: Anyone but not her
6/21/24, 21:17 - Purvi: No I can
6/21/24, 21:17 - Purvi: She is a good secret keeper
6/21/24, 21:18 - HrishavSaha: Are you SURE?
6/21/24, 21:18 - Purvi: Maybe after sometime
6/21/24, 21:18 - HrishavSaha: No worries
6/21/24, 21:18 - HrishavSaha: I'm personally not against telling them
6/21/24, 21:18 - Purvi: Wait she s texting me

6/21/24, 21:19 - HrishavSaha: Okayy

6/21/24, 21:22 - HrishavSaha: 😂😂
6/21/24, 21:22 - HrishavSaha: I thought you and Mishthi were great friends?
6/21/24, 21:22 - Purvi: In theory we were but
6/21/24, 21:22 - Purvi: Pari
6/21/24, 21:22 - Purvi: Was like the
6/21/24, 21:23 - Purvi: Badha
6/21/24, 21:23 - HrishavSaha: That's... One way to put it
6/21/24, 21:23 - Purvi: Not a nice word
6/21/24, 21:23 - HrishavSaha: Yeah
6/21/24, 21:23 - HrishavSaha: But I understand why Pari's got friendship issues
6/21/24, 21:24 - HrishavSaha: What she doesn't understand is that she's the issue
6/21/24, 21:24 - Purvi: She is a really great frnd of mine
6/21/24, 21:24 - Purvi: But
6/21/24, 21:24 - HrishavSaha: Or maybe she does understand, and she's in denial
6/21/24, 21:24 - Purvi: She isn't really a great frnd herself
6/21/24, 21:24 - Purvi: It's the first one
6/21/24, 21:24 - HrishavSaha: Guess so
6/21/24, 21:24 - HrishavSaha: Either way
6/21/24, 21:25 - HrishavSaha: This convo ain't about Pari and her problems
6/21/24, 21:25 - HrishavSaha: So, the matter at hand
6/21/24, 21:25 - HrishavSaha: What's your current plan of action?
6/21/24, 21:26 - Purvi: In general or about mishthi
6/21/24, 21:26 - HrishavSaha: Tell me both
6/21/24, 21:26 - Purvi: K we ll tell mishthi whenever we get the chance
6/21/24, 21:26 - Purvi: I guess
6/21/24, 21:26 - HrishavSaha: Okay
6/21/24, 21:27 - Purvi: In general we re gonna watch panchayat abhi
6/21/24, 21:27 - HrishavSaha: 😂Okay
6/21/24, 21:27 - HrishavSaha: What's the criteria for knowing when the "chance" is?
6/21/24, 21:28 - Purvi: Probably clubhouse when we are not playing
6/21/24, 21:28 - Purvi: I guess
6/21/24, 21:28 - HrishavSaha: In my presence?
6/21/24, 21:28 - Purvi: Yeahh
6/21/24, 21:28 - HrishavSaha: Okayy
6/21/24, 21:29 - HrishavSaha: Well, that settles it
6/21/24, 21:29 - HrishavSaha: But I suggest we keep a failsafe
6/21/24, 21:29 - Purvi: Huh?
6/21/24, 21:29 - HrishavSaha: A plan to fall back on, in case the fact we're dating leaks out, to parents OR pari
6/21/24, 21:29 - HrishavSaha: In other words
6/21/24, 21:30 - HrishavSaha: What story should we cook up?
6/21/24, 21:30 - Purvi: Simple

6/21/24, 21:39 - HrishavSaha: 😂
6/21/24, 21:39 - Purvi: You are terribly misunderstanding this
6/21/24, 21:39 - Purvi: 😂😂
6/21/24, 21:40 - HrishavSaha: Look, first step to a relationship is trust. And I trust you. A lot more than I show, and should
6/21/24, 21:40 - HrishavSaha: 😂😂
6/21/24, 21:40 - Purvi: Same I do too
6/21/24, 21:40 - HrishavSaha: Mmhmm
6/21/24, 21:41 - HrishavSaha: And surprisingly enough, you're a lot more vocal about your trust in me than I can probably ever be
6/21/24, 21:41 - Purvi: Yeah😂✨
6/21/24, 21:41 - HrishavSaha: I repeat myself all the time
6/21/24, 21:41 - HrishavSaha: And you know the reason why
6/21/24, 21:42 - HrishavSaha: And so
6/21/24, 21:42 - HrishavSaha: I'll repeat again, for the hundredth time (I'm not stopping, ever)

6/21/24, 21:46 - HrishavSaha: Like, I touch a lot and all
6/21/24, 21:46 - Purvi: Mhmm
6/21/24, 21:47 - HrishavSaha: If it bothers you at any time, just let me know
6/21/24, 21:48 - HrishavSaha: It's just that the warmth of a human body... Of someone I love, specifically.... It's addictive, and reassuring. Makes me feel safe, a lot less vulnerable
6/21/24, 21:48 - HrishavSaha: I sound weird rn😂
6/21/24, 21:48 - Purvi: Noo😂✨✨

6/22/24, 20:57 - HrishavSaha: I'll answer from personal experience
6/22/24, 20:57 - HrishavSaha: You originally seemed a little like the kind of person who only focuses on self interest
6/22/24, 20:58 - HrishavSaha: That's a sweet way of calling someone selfish😂
6/22/24, 20:58 - Purvi: 🥲
6/22/24, 20:58 - Purvi: 😂😂
6/22/24, 20:58 - HrishavSaha: But I know you're not
6/22/24, 20:58 - HrishavSaha: I mean, we're all selfish on some level. And we should be
6/22/24, 20:58 - HrishavSaha: But you're not enough to be LABELLED selfish
6/22/24, 20:59 - Purvi: What made you change your mind
6/22/24, 20:59 - HrishavSaha: If anything, you're really understanding and caring towards people you love
6/22/24, 20:59 - HrishavSaha: Changes that I saw in you
6/22/24, 21:00 - HrishavSaha: You may not realise it, but you've changed A LOT since the "shut the" incident
6/22/24, 21:00 - Purvi: Thats cause I did try
6/22/24, 21:00 - HrishavSaha: Yeah
6/22/24, 21:00 - HrishavSaha: I assure you
6/22/24, 21:00 - Purvi: And I realised I didn't wanna be that person
6/22/24, 21:00 - HrishavSaha: If you were still the old you
6/22/24, 21:01 - HrishavSaha: I wouldn't have wanted to forge a relationship with you
6/22/24, 21:01 - HrishavSaha: I may have still liked you, but I would've kept it to myself. Tried to forget it, supress
6/22/24, 21:01 - HrishavSaha: Suppress*
6/22/24, 21:01 - HrishavSaha: But you're different now
6/22/24, 21:02 - HrishavSaha: A lot... Softer, more understanding, open minded and caring
6/22/24, 21:02 - Purvi: Ohk progress
6/22/24, 21:02 - Purvi: I guess
6/22/24, 21:02 - HrishavSaha: I don't call this progress
6/22/24, 21:03 - HrishavSaha: Calling it progress is an insult
6/22/24, 21:03 - HrishavSaha: This is growth
6/22/24, 21:03 - HrishavSaha: Maturacy
6/22/24, 21:03 - HrishavSaha: You're mature now
6/22/24, 21:03 - Purvi: Ohk thankss
6/22/24, 21:04 - Purvi: But I don't wanna be that person too😂😂
6/22/24, 21:04 - HrishavSaha: Who wants to be the person they are? 😂
6/22/24, 21:04 - HrishavSaha: We're all searching for a better version of ourselves
6/22/24, 21:04 - Purvi: Trueee
6/22/24, 21:05 - HrishavSaha: And I don't mean to judge you
6/22/24, 21:05 - HrishavSaha: But may I say something?
6/22/24, 21:05 - Purvi: Say
6/22/24, 21:05 - HrishavSaha: Again, please don't mind what I say
6/22/24, 21:05 - HrishavSaha: And if you do, I'm sorry in advance. I might be overstepping my authority here
6/22/24, 21:06 - Purvi: Say
6/22/24, 21:06 - HrishavSaha: You've got a sort of... Obsession? For money
6/22/24, 21:06 - HrishavSaha: I mean
6/22/24, 21:06 - HrishavSaha: Yeah, money is important
6/22/24, 21:07 - HrishavSaha: It's really important
6/22/24, 21:07 - HrishavSaha: Can't survive without it
6/22/24, 21:07 - Purvi: See I ve tried to change that and lie to myself
6/22/24, 21:07 - Purvi: I just can't seem to find the source of it
6/22/24, 21:08 - Purvi: What could be the source?
6/22/24, 21:08 - Purvi: You tell
6/22/24, 21:08 - HrishavSaha: Do you WANT to change that?
6/22/24, 21:08 - Purvi: Not entirely but
6/22/24, 21:09 - Purvi: I do want to be less obsessed with money💀
6/22/24, 21:09 - HrishavSaha: There's no less or more with obsession
6/22/24, 21:09 - HrishavSaha: It's either obsession or no obsession
6/22/24, 21:09 - HrishavSaha: I'm obsessed with you
6/22/24, 21:09 - HrishavSaha: There's no less or more
6/22/24, 21:10 - Purvi: I don't want to talk abt this
6/22/24, 21:10 - HrishavSaha: Alright
6/22/24, 21:10 - HrishavSaha: I'm sorry if I said something offensive
6/22/24, 21:11 - Purvi: K anyways
6/22/24, 21:11 - Purvi: Your turn
6/22/24, 21:11 - HrishavSaha: Same question, I guess
6/22/24, 21:12 - Purvi: There is no personal experience with this
6/22/24, 21:13 - Purvi: Maybe it's you are not the golden retriever person
6/22/24, 21:14 - Purvi: That most people think you are
6/22/24, 21:14 - HrishavSaha: Golden retriever person?
6/22/24, 21:14 - Purvi: Yk more on the black cat side
6/22/24, 21:14 - Purvi: Goddd
6/22/24, 21:14 - Purvi: Ohk
6/22/24, 21:14 - HrishavSaha: Sorry
6/22/24, 21:15 - Purvi: For what😂😂
6/22/24, 21:15 - HrishavSaha: For not knowing that term
6/22/24, 21:16 - Purvi: 💀
6/22/24, 21:16 - Purvi: Like be fr
6/22/24, 21:16 - HrishavSaha: I said some stuff earlier
6/22/24, 21:16 - HrishavSaha: That I shouldn't have
6/22/24, 21:16 - HrishavSaha: I'm sorry
6/22/24, 21:18 - Purvi: What stuff?
6/22/24, 21:18 - Purvi: 😂😂
6/22/24, 21:18 - HrishavSaha: The money thing
6/22/24, 21:19 - Purvi: K it's whatever
6/22/24, 21:19 - Purvi: Continuing
6/22/24, 21:20 - Purvi: So you don't know the golden retriever black cat comparison?
6/22/24, 21:20 - HrishavSaha: No
6/22/24, 21:21 - Purvi: So just imagine what's the diff between a golden retriever personality
6/22/24, 21:21 - Purvi: And a black cat personality
6/22/24, 21:21 - Purvi: Think abt it
6/22/24, 21:21 - HrishavSaha: Idk, um
6/22/24, 21:22 - HrishavSaha: Golden retriever would be the "I'm good and caring" personality?
6/22/24, 21:22 - Purvi: Not exactly
6/22/24, 21:22 - Purvi: Not at all
6/22/24, 21:23 - HrishavSaha: Then?
6/22/24, 21:23 - Purvi: Optimist and spontaneous
6/22/24, 21:23 - Purvi: Mysterious and pessimistic
6/22/24, 21:23 - HrishavSaha: Ah
6/22/24, 21:24 - HrishavSaha: So I'm more mysterious and pessimistic
6/22/24, 21:24 - HrishavSaha: But people might initially think I'm optimistic and spontaneous
6/22/24, 21:24 - Purvi: No you are more neutral
6/22/24, 21:24 - Purvi: But ha
6/22/24, 21:24 - HrishavSaha: So a bit of both worlds
6/22/24, 21:25 - Purvi: Ha
6/22/24, 21:25 - HrishavSaha: Me being called mysterious is new though
6/22/24, 21:25 - HrishavSaha: I've been called a pessimist a lot
6/22/24, 21:25 - HrishavSaha: (I'm actually a realist)
6/22/24, 21:25 - HrishavSaha: But why mysterious?
6/22/24, 21:26 - Purvi: Idk 💀
6/22/24, 21:26 - Purvi: But you are kinda I guess
6/22/24, 21:26 - Purvi: But more neutral again
6/22/24, 21:26 - HrishavSaha: 😅
6/22/24, 21:26 - HrishavSaha: Well
6/22/24, 21:27 - HrishavSaha: What do you think I should change about myself?
6/22/24, 21:28 - Purvi: Just know that ppl do get you
6/22/24, 21:28 - HrishavSaha: Get me?
6/22/24, 21:29 - Purvi: It's nothinggg
6/22/24, 21:29 - Purvi: I don't even know what it exactly is
6/22/24, 21:29 - Purvi: K
6/22/24, 21:29 - HrishavSaha: Cmon, atleast explain properly
6/22/24, 21:29 - Purvi: I just felt like you thought that
6/22/24, 21:29 - Purvi: You probably dont
6/22/24, 21:30 - HrishavSaha: What do you mean by "get you"?
6/22/24, 21:30 - Purvi: Like understand you😂😂
6/22/24, 21:30 - HrishavSaha: Oh
6/22/24, 21:30 - Purvi: Get it
6/22/24, 21:30 - HrishavSaha: Yeah
6/22/24, 21:31 - Purvi: Yeah so
6/22/24, 21:31 - HrishavSaha: Well, I do feel like Dr. Ratio sometimes
6/22/24, 21:31 - HrishavSaha: So I don't usually think people understand me much
6/22/24, 21:31 - HrishavSaha: If anything, I'm sure a lot of people think I'm strange
6/22/24, 21:32 - HrishavSaha: I mean, which guy studies like his life depends on it and also games like his life depends on it
6/22/24, 21:33 - Purvi: Yeah so that's not the case
6/22/24, 21:33 - Purvi: Not the case at all
6/22/24, 21:33 - HrishavSaha: And not to mention my... Unpopular opinions
6/22/24, 21:34 - Purvi: Like what exactly
6/22/24, 21:34 - HrishavSaha: Plus I myself think I'm weird for wanting to be in constant skin contact with my girl. Like, don't you feel weird and uncomfortable when I'm constantly hugging you and kissing you over and over again?
6/22/24, 21:35 - HrishavSaha: You know, my fatalistic and pessimistic perspective on life. My lack of belief in God. So on and so forth
6/22/24, 21:36 - Purvi: If you think that ppl don't understand that
6/22/24, 21:36 - Purvi: I guess that could be wrong
6/22/24, 21:36 - Purvi: Idk what I am saying
6/22/24, 21:36 - Purvi: I guess that's probably for me
6/22/24, 21:36 - Purvi: Most probably
6/22/24, 21:37 - HrishavSaha: No no, what I meant to say is that such opinions usually get me on the bad side of people
6/22/24, 21:37 - Purvi: You could make that less
6/22/24, 21:37 - Purvi: It's fine
6/22/24, 21:38 - HrishavSaha: Yeah, ikr?
6/22/24, 21:38 - Purvi: They do not I guess
6/22/24, 21:38 - Purvi: Not exactly sure
6/22/24, 21:38 - Purvi: It's whatever
6/22/24, 21:39 - HrishavSaha: You told me to tell you when I feel insecure, right?
6/22/24, 21:39 - Purvi: Yeah
6/22/24, 21:40 - HrishavSaha: You're not really just playing along cuz you don't wanna hurt my feelings, are you?
6/22/24, 21:40 - HrishavSaha: You can tell me if you are
6/22/24, 21:40 - Purvi: No no am not
6/22/24, 21:40 - Purvi: I am not sure
6/22/24, 21:41 - HrishavSaha: I'd understand if you even hate me right now, for all that hugging and kissing and what not
6/22/24, 21:41 - Purvi: I don't hate you
6/22/24, 21:41 - HrishavSaha: Do you want some time to think?
6/22/24, 21:41 - Purvi: I said am not sure abt this
6/22/24, 21:42 - Purvi: Pagal
6/22/24, 21:42 - HrishavSaha: Oh
6/22/24, 21:42 - HrishavSaha: I am not, sure
6/22/24, 21:42 - HrishavSaha: The difference a comma can make
6/22/24, 21:42 - HrishavSaha: 😂
6/22/24, 21:42 - Purvi: 💀
6/22/24, 21:42 - HrishavSaha: Sorry
6/22/24, 21:43 - HrishavSaha: Just
6/22/24, 21:43 - HrishavSaha: Idk
6/22/24, 21:43 - Purvi: And yeah make it less
6/22/24, 21:43 - HrishavSaha: I feel like more of a burden than someone to love
6/22/24, 21:43 - HrishavSaha: I will
6/22/24, 21:43 - Purvi: Are u pagal
6/22/24, 21:44 - Purvi: You are
6/22/24, 21:44 - HrishavSaha: 😂

6/22/24, 21:44 - HrishavSaha: I am, yeah
6/22/24, 21:44 - Purvi: 💀
6/22/24, 21:44 - Purvi: Dont
6/22/24, 21:44 - HrishavSaha: Don't what?
6/22/24, 21:45 - Purvi: Dont think that stupid
6/22/24, 21:46 - HrishavSaha: Okay, ma'am
6/22/24, 21:46 - HrishavSaha: I'll... Try
6/22/24, 21:46 - HrishavSaha: It's something I hate about myself
6/22/24, 21:46 - HrishavSaha: My overthinking
6/22/24, 21:47 - HrishavSaha: My pessimism
6/22/24, 21:47 - HrishavSaha: The belief that I'm inferior
6/22/24, 21:47 - HrishavSaha: Heck, I hate half of myself😂
6/22/24, 21:47 - Purvi: Inferior?
6/22/24, 21:48 - HrishavSaha: Less than others
6/22/24, 21:48 - Purvi: I meant why would you think that
6/22/24, 21:48 - HrishavSaha: Idk
6/22/24, 21:48 - Purvi: But I love you
6/22/24, 21:48 - Purvi: And you should too
6/22/24, 21:49 - HrishavSaha: Reminds me of a song I listen sometimes
6/22/24, 21:49 - HrishavSaha: Wait
6/22/24, 21:53 - HrishavSaha: <Media omitted>
6/22/24, 21:54 - Purvi: 😂😂
6/22/24, 21:54 - HrishavSaha: The lyrics are sorta relatable
6/22/24, 21:54 - Purvi: Yeah I guess
6/22/24, 21:54 - Purvi: And btw everyone hates themselves
6/22/24, 21:55 - Purvi: I guess some just go in denieal and some accept it😂😂
6/22/24, 21:55 - HrishavSaha: 😂
6/22/24, 21:55 - HrishavSaha: I guesa
6/22/24, 21:55 - HrishavSaha: I mean
6/22/24, 21:55 - HrishavSaha: I wonder sometimes
6/22/24, 21:56 - HrishavSaha: What is it that you saw in me that you love
6/22/24, 21:57 - Purvi: Why does that matter😂😂
6/22/24, 21:57 - Purvi: I love youuuuuuu
6/22/24, 21:58 - HrishavSaha: Well, what's the point if the thing you love about me is gone

6/23/24, 11:29 - Purvi: 💀
6/23/24, 11:29 - Purvi: Cameras check honge most probably
6/23/24, 11:30 - Purvi: Bc of broken gym equipments and games room ke bhi
6/23/24, 11:30 - Purvi: Yarrrrrrr
6/23/24, 11:30 - Purvi: Hsksbgkognels so

6/23/24, 11:36 - HrishavSaha: Oh
6/23/24, 11:37 - HrishavSaha: That shouldn't be much of an issue, would it?
6/23/24, 11:37 - Purvi: Pagalll ho kya aapp
6/23/24, 11:37 - HrishavSaha: 1. It'll be subhash uncle doing the checking
6/23/24, 11:38 - HrishavSaha: 2. Nobody has the patience to check all cameras for the entire length of time
6/23/24, 11:38 - HrishavSaha: 3. They'll mostly focus on gym, cuz most equipments are broken there. We didn't do anything at the gym
6/23/24, 11:38 - Purvi: Their was the bandar incident mentioned
6/23/24, 11:39 - HrishavSaha: 4. There's nothing broken at the games room, except a single ping pong ball
6/23/24, 11:39 - Purvi: Nhi
6/23/24, 11:39 - HrishavSaha: Then?
6/23/24, 11:39 - Purvi: Either Subhash uncle, garima aunty, priyanka aunty, ya the dada ji
6/23/24, 11:39 - Purvi: Swtu ke
6/23/24, 11:39 - Purvi: Rajesh uncle
6/23/24, 11:40 - HrishavSaha: Well, let's just hope it's not Priyanka aunty
6/23/24, 11:40 - HrishavSaha: That's it. The others can't care less about us
6/23/24, 11:40 - Purvi: Tell me who is Subhash uncle's wife
6/23/24, 11:40 - HrishavSaha: Priyanka aunty
6/23/24, 11:40 - Purvi: You picked me a up a total of 3 times😂😂💀bruhhh
6/23/24, 11:40 - Purvi: Exactly
6/23/24, 11:41 - HrishavSaha: 😂
6/23/24, 11:41 - Purvi: Of course he ll tell her
6/23/24, 11:41 - HrishavSaha: He might. He might not. But he's responsible. I trust him with maintaining our privacy
6/23/24, 11:41 - HrishavSaha: INFACT
6/23/24, 11:42 - HrishavSaha: We could actually go up to subhash uncle, tell him we're dating and not to disclose this information to others
6/23/24, 11:42 - Purvi: It's not just him
6/23/24, 11:42 - HrishavSaha: I know
6/23/24, 11:42 - Purvi: Look he is chill
6/23/24, 11:42 - HrishavSaha: Yeaj
6/23/24, 11:42 - HrishavSaha: If we do tell him, I'm sure he'll try and manage something
6/23/24, 11:43 - Purvi: But garima aunty and Rajesh uncle💀
6/23/24, 11:43 - Purvi: Noooo
6/23/24, 11:43 - Purvi: I am pretty sure he ll not
6/23/24, 11:43 - HrishavSaha: Why not
6/23/24, 11:43 - Purvi: What if he doesn't
6/23/24, 11:43 - HrishavSaha: Well, atleast he won't make our dating fact public
6/23/24, 11:43 - HrishavSaha: So it's not a risk telling him
6/23/24, 11:44 - Purvi: He would tell my parents
6/23/24, 11:44 - Purvi: He and my papa are like very good frnds
6/23/24, 11:44 - Purvi: Yarrr
6/23/24, 11:44 - HrishavSaha: I don't think so, purvi
6/23/24, 11:44 - HrishavSaha: He and my dad are good friends too
6/23/24, 11:44 - HrishavSaha: Look
6/23/24, 11:45 - HrishavSaha: If we don't do anything
6/23/24, 11:45 - Purvi: I think we can just ask him if the games room camera are going to be checked
6/23/24, 11:45 - HrishavSaha: Chances are that us dating will become common knowledge
6/23/24, 11:45 - HrishavSaha: Right?
6/23/24, 11:45 - HrishavSaha: That's possible
6/23/24, 11:45 - Purvi: Ummm i have my doubts
6/23/24, 11:46 - Purvi: If he says no we can just tell him we were asking bc we didn't keep the things in place
6/23/24, 11:46 - Purvi: And we are srry
6/23/24, 11:46 - HrishavSaha: Alright, I guess
6/23/24, 11:46 - Purvi: If he says yes then we ll tell.him
6/23/24, 11:46 - HrishavSaha: Okay
6/23/24, 11:47 - Purvi: But aise Ghar par jaakar puchenge
6/23/24, 11:47 - Purvi: That will be sus
6/23/24, 11:47 - HrishavSaha: What do we do then?
6/23/24, 11:47 - HrishavSaha: Catch him on the road?
6/23/24, 11:47 - Purvi: Am not going😂😂
6/23/24, 11:48 - HrishavSaha: 😂
6/23/24, 11:48 - HrishavSaha: Fine, I guess
6/23/24, 11:48 - HrishavSaha: Whoever catches him on the road asks him about the camera
6/23/24, 11:48 - HrishavSaha: Deal?
6/23/24, 11:48 - Purvi: Ok deal
6/23/24, 11:48 - HrishavSaha: Just a heads up though, purvi
6/23/24, 11:48 - Purvi: But it's your fricking fault
6/23/24, 11:48 - Purvi: You re stupid
6/23/24, 11:48 - Purvi: I warned you
6/23/24, 11:48 - HrishavSaha: I know
6/23/24, 11:49 - HrishavSaha: I'm sorry
6/23/24, 11:49 - HrishavSaha: Though that doesn't change much
6/23/24, 11:49 - Purvi: What
6/23/24, 11:49 - HrishavSaha: We should still prepare for the possibility that our parents might get aware of us dating
6/23/24, 11:49 - HrishavSaha: Chances are low, but not zero
6/23/24, 11:50 - Purvi: That would be reallyyyyy bad
6/23/24, 11:51 - Purvi: Mumma papa are really unpredictable
6/23/24, 11:51 - HrishavSaha: So are mine
6/23/24, 11:51 - Purvi: Tuitions toh almost pakka band ho jayengi
6/23/24, 11:51 - Purvi: Yupp
6/23/24, 11:52 - Purvi: Exactly
6/23/24, 11:52 - Purvi: 💀
6/23/24, 11:52 - HrishavSaha: Well
6/23/24, 11:52 - HrishavSaha: Let's be positive
6/23/24, 11:52 - Purvi: 💀🤦🏻‍♀️
6/23/24, 11:52 - HrishavSaha: Given my intuition
6/23/24, 11:52 - Purvi: Ek sec but
6/23/24, 11:53 - Purvi: How often do we see Subhash uncle road par
6/23/24, 11:53 - Purvi: Chalte chalte
6/23/24, 11:53 - Purvi: Cameras toh recently hi check karenge na
6/23/24, 11:53 - Purvi: We should ask guard uncle
6/23/24, 11:53 - Purvi: Maybe he ll check
6/23/24, 11:53 - HrishavSaha: I'd say the someone somewhere will get to know that we're dating. But:
1. They'll keep quite OR
2. They'll spread a rumour. Rumours are easy to handle
6/23/24, 11:53 - HrishavSaha: Possible. We can ask
6/23/24, 11:54 - HrishavSaha: Do you have the exact notice given in the society group?
6/23/24, 11:54 - Purvi: Mumma ke phone par
6/23/24, 11:54 - Purvi: Wait
6/23/24, 11:54 - HrishavSaha: Okay
6/23/24, 11:56 - Purvi: Also, I visited Club House yesterday evening nd observed below

1.The entry gate of game area is not working properly and has become very risky for kids to open.
2.The locks of all 3 floor gates is not working
3.The lift was decided to be locked so that kids do not use it when they r alone but it is never locked  nd kids r using it even alone nd this is risky.
4.On 2nd floor the games were not properly arranged and it is a complete mess. The balls of TT were not in place, Chairs were lying here nd there. The cleaning person or the guard is to be guided to arrange it properly everyday nd this shud b randomly checked.
5.There was a incident when Monkey came inside from the open window. Kids shud b strictly advised not to open window as this might b very risky and also there is AC on all floors.
6.Few gadgets/machines at 1st floor r broken nd not working properly. 

My request to the members who r responsible for Club House to take note of above points and act accordingly pls.
6/23/24, 11:57 - Purvi: Oh
6/23/24, 11:57 - Purvi: Ek sec
6/23/24, 11:57 - Purvi: Mujhe toh mumma ne bola ki cameras check honge
6/23/24, 11:57 - Purvi: It's not mentioned here
6/23/24, 11:57 - HrishavSaha: PHEW
6/23/24, 11:58 - Purvi: She is probably trying to scare me
6/23/24, 11:58 - Purvi: 💀
6/23/24, 11:58 - HrishavSaha: Possible
6/23/24, 11:58 - Purvi: And I got scared
6/23/24, 11:58 - HrishavSaha: She IS sus of us
6/23/24, 11:58 - Purvi: Yeah definitely
6/23/24, 11:58 - HrishavSaha: Maybe she was trying to get a reaction out of you
6/23/24, 11:58 - HrishavSaha: What's important now is that you maintain calmness
6/23/24, 11:59 - HrishavSaha: And stop with the furious typing😂
6/23/24, 11:59 - HrishavSaha: If she's noticed you're typing like crazy, consider yourself done
6/23/24, 11:59 - Purvi: Am upstairs
6/23/24, 11:59 - HrishavSaha: Okay, that's good
6/23/24, 12:00 - Purvi: And I am not furious typing
6/23/24, 12:00 - Purvi: Am I
6/23/24, 12:00 - HrishavSaha: You are😂
6/23/24, 12:00 - HrishavSaha: But chill
6/23/24, 12:00 - HrishavSaha: We're good
6/23/24, 12:00 - HrishavSaha: See
6/23/24, 12:00 - HrishavSaha: Here's the problem with cameras
6/23/24, 12:00 - Purvi: And so from now on nothing in the club
6/23/24, 12:00 - Purvi: And we ll still ask the guard
6/23/24, 12:01 - Purvi: K gotta go
6/23/24, 12:01 - Purvi: Byeeeeee
6/23/24, 12:03 - HrishavSaha: They're constantly recording video and writing the data to a storage medium. But there's a limit to how much data can be stored. And hence, old recording are deleted to make space for new ones. Now, we don't know HOW OLD data is deleted. But I'd guess anything older than 2 weeks is deleted. Then there's no audio and there's no need to check cams since there hasn't been any major damage to anything. The damage we saw at the gym is common. So we're good, okay?
6/23/24, 12:03 - HrishavSaha: Okayy
6/23/24, 12:03 - HrishavSaha: Byee
6/23/24, 13:33 - Purvi: Ohk
6/23/24, 13:33 - Purvi: Heyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy
6/23/24, 13:44 - Purvi: Dear Students
